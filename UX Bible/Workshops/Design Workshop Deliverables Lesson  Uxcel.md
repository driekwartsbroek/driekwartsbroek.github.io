# Design Workshop Deliverables Lesson  Uxcel
## Types of documentation and deliverables

![Types of documentation and deliverables](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/types-of-documentation-and-deliverables-1670261879666/a-1670261879666.jpg)

A facilitator's primary goal is to document all insights generated during a workshop and ensure that team members can easily refer to them in the future.

**Your team may need workshop deliverables for:**

-   Planning the next steps
-   Making a final design solution
-   Proving your point in a disagreement
-   Planning the next workshop

Depending on the type of workshop, teams can develop different types of deliverables. For example, during a discovery workshop, you'll probably get a [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) vision board, product roadmap, and [UX](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) strategy canvas. Ideation workshops can result in sketches and affinity maps, and so on.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

**Tip!** If it's a remote workshop, make sure to save all the digital assets and record the session so that you can retrieve any ideas that weren't captured on the digital board.

## Notes

One of the primary sources of workshop [documentation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/documentation) includes notes taken by the facilitator during the workshop and notes generated by participants on critical topics. The team may use these notes as a reference point to support an idea or clarify things in the future. If you don’t like the idea of storing piles of sticky notes or sheets of paper, you can digitize them in a simple Google Docs or Notion file. Beware, however, that it’s a time-consuming task.

**Tip!** You don’t need to collect all notes — keep only those containing the most valuable insights.

## Photos of shared outputs

During in-person and hybrid workshops, facilitators often use whiteboards and easels to capture participants' ideas, [sketch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/sketch) user personas, or jot down the product vision. All products of shared outputs should be documented and saved since they represent the entire team's work.

Take [photos](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos) of whiteboards and easels so that people can reference them in the future. Plus, it's much easier to upload digital assets to a cloud service and share them instantly with team members or clients instead of storing piles of paper.

## Individual outputs

Workshops often include activities that participants are expected to complete individually. For example, during ideation workshops, participants often spend the first part of the session reflecting on a problem and developing ideas on their own, and then they may converge and consolidate those ideas.

You don't need to store all of the participants' notes. Prioritize and decide on which outputs should be digitized for easy referencing in the future.

**Tip!** At the end of the workshop, ask for feedback and collect participants’ notes to analyze and improve future sessions.

## Requirements

The goals of discovery workshops include defining the requirements, documenting the project scope and milestones, and describing project processes. It's crucial to thoroughly document this data and digitize it soon after the workshop for further reference.

Requirements can be determined during other types of design workshops as well. The point is that a facilitator should be prepared to write down the requirements or take a picture of them on the whiteboard before the team gets carried away with discussions and forgets about them.

## Next steps

By the end of the workshop discussions, the team often comes together to define the next steps. They generally include certain activities — for example, clarifying user needs by scheduling a few [interviews](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview), updating a user persona if necessary, [wireframing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wireframing) a possible design solution, discussing its possible technical requirements with the dev team, etc. The next steps will also include one or more assignees responsible for these tasks along with the due date.

A clear outline and concrete goals help the team see the tangible results of the workshop and motivate them to keep going.

## Roles and responsibilities

Workshops conducted at the early stages of a project usually lead to the definition of [roles](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/roles) and responsibilities. Documenting this information helps avoid confusion about who on a team is responsible for each task.

For example, is your UX [designer](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) responsible for [user research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-research) and [information architecture](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/information-architecture) on a project, or do you have a [UX researcher](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-researcher) or information architect to take care of those tasks? Who does the [UX copy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-writing) for designs — UX writers, UX designers, or [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) designers? Who is responsible for aggregating and analyzing [UX research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research) findings? How does the team process bugs?

The goal is not to create a long-read document that takes time and effort to scan. Team members and other stakeholders should be able to access this workshop deliverable whenever they need to find and refresh data quickly.

**Tip!** Assigning too many responsibilities to one person can lead to burnout. This can be prevented by hiring a new team member or extending sprint periods.

## Post-workshop report

Once the workshop is done, facilitators should take some time to document the findings that came out of it. If the workshop spans a few days, be sure to document each day thoroughly.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Ideally, the post-workshop report should align with the [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of outcomes created at the beginning of the workshop to plan and structure the session. The document may include attachments or [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) to other deliverables (screens, ideas, notes, [user flows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow), etc.) stored in the cloud and demonstrate the workshop's benefits to the participants and stakeholders.

**Tip!** Make sure the post-workshop report includes participants’ feedback on what they liked about the workshop and what can be improved.
