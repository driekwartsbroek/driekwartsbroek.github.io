According to studies by the Baymard Institute, your website or [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) app should provide as many payment methods as you can if you sell internationally and don't want your users to have any trouble sending money for your product/service.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> However, it's true that seeing too many unnecessary payment options confuses users and causes choice paralysis. So what's the best solution?

Learn your audience and provide a range of payment options that are relevant to them. For example, credit [cards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) are becoming less dominant in many countries like Germany, Russia, and China. If you don't sell to the UK, there's no point in offering BACS Direct Debit payment options.

## Request payment details

When requesting payment information from users, it's important to ensure that all relevant text [inputs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) are provided and that their [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) is appropriate for the details being entered. Some inputs may require users to provide unfamiliar or unclear information, in which case it's helpful to offer a brief but informative explanation. One effective way to do this is to include an information [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) that users can click for more details.

**Tip!** In a product where users may make repeat purchases and saved payment methods are available, consider a flow that allows users to add/remove payment methods.

## Submit payment with card details entered

Users are humans, and they make mistakes, especially when entering payment details on mobile and using one hand. It's vital to consider adding validation before users submit their payment details. Users mistype numbers, or the card may have expired — so make sure to address these numerous error [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states).

To make users' lives a bit easier, consider adding input masks _—_ i.e., constraints on the input text. Masks help ensure that numbers or strings meet the expected format, prevent any unnecessary [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors), and reduce friction prior to system validation.

## Show payment processing

Payments may not be processed instantly and can take a few seconds or even a few minutes. Therefore, it's crucial to add a [loading](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/loading) [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) to reassure users and alleviate any concerns they may have about their payment. By displaying the current [status](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/status) of the system, users are more likely to trust the payment process and feel in control of the transaction. This can help increase credibility and improve the overall [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience).

## Confirmation of payment processed successfully

Once users have submitted their payment, a success message should appear, confirming that the payment has been processed and the funds have been received. This provides a sense of satisfaction and completion to users. To ensure that the success [notification](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications) is effective, it should be clearly visible and given enough time to be read by users.

## Outline next steps

After users have made a payment, it's important not to give the impression that your job is done. Instead, take the opportunity to express gratitude and offer information about the next steps if needed. For example, if they have purchased a product, thank them for choosing your [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) and provide them with shipping updates. If users have signed up for a [subscription](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/subscription), provide them with a [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) to start using the product or suggest that they check their [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) to activate the subscription.

This helps build a positive relationship with users and ensures that they are fully informed about their purchase.
