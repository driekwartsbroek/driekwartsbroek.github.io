# User Onboarding
## Passive onboarding

Passive onboarding gives users a quick and efficient tour around the product. It usually includes 4–5 screens with brief how-to-get-around instructions and [illustrations](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/illustration) that support the idea. Passive onboarding should focus on the most important [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) and tips of a product to keep them short.

**Tip!** If screens are visually appealing, users are more likely to complete the onboarding. Give users the option to skip it anyway.

## Active onboarding

Active onboarding is the perfect living example of the practice makes perfect principle. It guides users step by step through completing the primary task of an app, allowing them to try the product themselves. This kind of active practice gets users more invested in using the product, increasing the chances they’ll become loyal users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Tip walkthrough

[Walkthroughs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/walkthrough) using [tooltips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) are an unobtrusive way to guide users through an interface. They generally appear as boxes attached to specific elements, with helpful tips that point out functions that might not be immediately apparent in usage. They provide useful information to users as needed without overloading them with instructions all at once.

**Tip!** Too many tooltips can overwhelm and annoy users, so avoid using them for obvious functions.

## Checklist walkthrough

Crossing things off a checklist is satisfying. That’s why checklist walkthroughs are an excellent way to onboard new users, showing them how to use your product while also providing a positive user experience. Onboarding that uses checklists motivates users to engage in the workflow and keep moving forward.

**Tip!** Keep walkthrough checklists short — they seem achievable and gently nudge users. Long lists can feel overwhelming — they seem impossible to complete and are likely to be abandoned.

## Make the introduction quick

Don’t bombard new users with a ton of questions. Asking for too many details before you’ve built trust and enthusiasm with those users feels like an imposition. Respect your users’ time and efforts by only asking for the minimum amount of information required to use the product, while also clearly identifying the value users will get.

**Tip!** Be sure to give users the option to close or skip onboarding questions.

## Persona-based questions

If you’ve created a product that could be used by different [personas](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/personas), it’s important to get an idea of which persona each of your users fits into. This allows you to optimize their experience, thereby turning them into more loyal users. Using persona-based onboarding questions lets you immediately identify the correct persona and tailor the onboarding journey for the best user experience.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Nudge users to fill empty states

Empty [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) can be confusing to users, especially if there’s no indication of what they’re supposed to do to fill those screens. Use this opportunity to guide users and help them complete a task, such as [setting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/settings) up their first project. If this is the first time they’ve used your product, adding a quick tutorial or a short video creates a better user experience.

## Encourage users to build habits

If you’ve ever tried to build a new habit — jogging weekly or eating more vegetables, say — you know how much effort it can take. Occasionally nudging users to interact can turn using your product into a habit. Engage them to invite friends, reward them for daily usage, or notify them about updates and new [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). These [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) will reinforce the habit and keep them coming back.

## Keep onboarding short and sweet

If your passive walkthrough feels more like a lecture than a quick tour, users likely won't find it helpful and will skip it entirely. 4-5 screens are usually enough to provide an efficient product or feature overview. Keep users engaged by making the walkthrough concise and focusing on the most exciting features.

**Tip!** According to Clutch’s findings, nearly 72% of users responded the onboarding process should take 60 seconds or less.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> Otherwise, they get bored and tend to leave.

## Reduce friction whenever possible

Let users know how many steps the onboarding process will take and give them an indication of where they are in that process. When users know exactly what to expect, it reduces friction and increases the likelihood that they'll complete the steps necessary.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> It keeps them more engaged and helps them make the most out of the onboarding experience.
