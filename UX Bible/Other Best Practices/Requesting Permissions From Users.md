## Avoid asking for permissions too soon

Asking for permissions too soon can come across like an uninvited guest showing up out of the blue. It can also increase the likelihood the users will deny those permissions. Don’t bombard your users with permissions as soon as they open your app for the first time.

Instead, ask for permissions only when they’re necessary for the [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) the user is trying to take. When asked for in this manner, users are significantly more likely to grant the necessary permissions.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Use modals to ask for permission

[Modal](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals) windows are the best option for asking permission. They’re intrusive, but in a positive way that users are sure to notice. 

Eventually, users will need to grant at least permission to use a specific feature that won’t work otherwise. For example, Google Maps will only let you do so much without location permission. While you could just send them to their [settings](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/settings) to find the appropriate permission to grant, it’s much more effective to simply offer them a modal that allows them to grant permission instantly.

## Prime users

Permissions request screens don’t give users much insight into why permission is being asked. And consider 82% of users want to know why an app is asking for information from them, that’s a problem.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> They’re likely to deny the permission if they don’t immediately understand what it’s for.

Before asking users for permission to access their [photos](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos) or camera, send [notifications](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications), or any other function, show them a primer. Primers explain why the app needs the permission and how it will benefit users before they’re actually asked for that permission. It increases the likelihood of that permission being granted.

**Tip!** A "primer" screen should always be in context — for example, ask for access to the camera when users want to take a picture.

## Give users a reason to grant permissions

According to a study from Nielsen Norman Group, users are 12% more likely to provide permissions when given a reason to do so (even if that reason isn’t particularly clear). And when that reason is compelling? It can increase the likelihood by 81%.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Clearly, giving users a compelling reason to grant your app permissions is vital to having them do so. Use plain, descriptive language to tell them exactly what the most important benefits are to granting permissions, and assure them the privilege won’t be abused.

**Tip!** Stick to the most important 1–2 reasons users should grant permission rather than giving them a long list.

## Use plain language

Users are more likely to grant permission if they’re given the reasoning behind why the app needs that permission and how it will use it.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> And yet so many developers don’t take advantage of the ability to create custom permission requests that explain that reasoning. Take the time to create [microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy) for these requests that provide a clear and straightforward explanation.

**Tip!** Users usually don't read permission text — they scan. So use plain language and keywords that capture attention and provide meaning. 

## Use active voice

Active voice is more effective when writing copy, particularly microcopy. As the term suggests, active voice implies action. It also helps users more intuitively understand who should act: you or them. Passive voice, on the other hand, can be confusing and wordy.

## Ask for permission in context

An app that asks users for permission to access their location, gallery, or camera out of the blue is less likely to get that permission, even with an explanation. In-context permissions, on the other hand, are logical to users and are more likely to be granted.

For example, if you ask users for permission to access their microphone as soon as they open the app, they may automatically deny the request without giving it much thought. If you ask when they tap on a microphone [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) in order to record audio, they can immediately make the connection to why it’s necessary and will be more likely to grant permission.

## Explain requests

Permission request modals interrupt the flow of users when they’re interacting with a new app. At the same time, they’re vital for an app to function as intended, so it’s important to get users to grant those permissions. To aid in that, give users a good reason to accept the permission request.

For example, when writing a request for a ride-sharing app, instead of “We use your location for personal notification,” say, “We use your location to improve your pick-ups and drop-offs.”

## Ask for one permission at a time

Asking for too much from users feels invasive. You should only ask them for one permission at a time. If the function the user is trying to access needs more than one permission, use separate modal windows for each one. It provides users more freedom to choose which permissions they allow or deny.

## Help users reverse their primary decision easily

Some users are very reluctant to give permissions unless absolutely necessary. Because of this, they may initially deny permissions that they’ll later decide to grant. In short, it takes time to build their trust.

When they finally do decide they need to grant permissions to use a particular function, make it easy for them to reverse their decision. Give them a polite explanation of why they can’t use the particular feature, and then give them a direct [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) to their [device](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device)’s settings in order to grant the permission.

## Don't trick users

[Designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) and developers sometimes use “[dark patterns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dark-pattern)” to influence or trick users into granting permissions they might not otherwise grant. They send requests when users are in the middle of a task or make it deliberately hard to deny permissions. For example, by adding a “Recommended” [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) to the desired options, designers pressure users to press “Allow.”

This kind of undue pressure can ruin user trust and come across as pushy. Instead, give users compelling reasons to allow permissions while also respecting their choice to do so. If the permission is really necessary, even if users initially deny it they’ll likely reconsider when they need it.
