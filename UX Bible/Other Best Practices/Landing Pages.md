Most users don’t read every word on the page. In fact, they may read as little as 20% of [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) copy. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

To combat this, try limiting your paragraphs to 3–4 lines and add descriptive subheadings every couple of paragraphs. This makes your [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) both more readable and more scannable. 

**Tip!** Nielsen Norman Group found that concise and scannable copywriting increases usability by more than 100%.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Use a compelling headline

Users [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) a first impression of your website in 0.05 seconds.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> That’s all the time you have to catch their attention and get them to stick around.

Headlines are one of the most important elements for grabbing a user’s attention. Stick to clear, concise headlines that are relevant to the central content and demand attention. Shorter is generally better in this case.

## Make the value proposition obvious

![[Attachments/573c546020df1114d4b5a38b4cdfc9bd_MD5.jpg]]

Your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product)’s value proposition can set it apart from competitors. It tells users how you provide more value to them than similar offerings might. That makes it some of the most important content on your landing page.

Your value proposition should tell your users what the product is, how it benefits them, and a bit about how it works — all in just a few words. Be sure that it’s clear and direct.

**Tip!** Consider combining a header, description, and video on your landing page to best convey your value proposition.

## Avoid jargon in your copy

![[Attachments/1fdc54c0207f1f5aa0e678f5f717ea4c_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/9aaad4381b65d5171d08caa3f972552b_MD5.jpg]]

If your product is targeted at a specialized group of users, you may use technical terms, but you should explain what they mean first. 

Clarity is key when it comes to landing page copy. By using technical jargon and complex vocabulary to impress readers, you sacrifice readability and credibility.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

While your colleagues might know exactly what you're talking about, the average user may not. Use simple language that's familiar to your audience and helps them navigate your product easily.

## Make your call-to-action button stand out

![[Attachments/1dd8a5ee1441e5cae629e5a4dd88ef99_MD5.jpg]]

A [Call-to-Action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) button acts as a signpost to users, letting them know what to do next. They may ask users to do things like subscribe, sign up, or make a purchase. They’re vital to the success of any landing page.

Because of the importance of Call-to-Action [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), it’s crucial that they stand out on the page. Use an accent [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) to make them more eye-catching to users. You might even consider using a [contrasting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) color outside of your landing page’s [color palette](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color-palette) for even better results.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Make your call-to-action button visible

Given the importance of CTAs, why would you hide them on your landing page below the cut? CTAs should be immediately and clearly visible, without requiring users to scroll. This makes users significantly more likely to click on your CTA.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup> Adding additional CTAs at regular intervals on longer pages can also increase conversions.

## Make your call-to-action label clear

![[Attachments/511cad47c497efddb2afc4d61ee87ac9_MD5.jpg]]

When asking users to take an [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions), being direct with them is the best policy. Use active verbs rather than passive phrasing, and avoid jargon or unclear wording. Remember that you’re asking people to take an action, so make it clear which action they’re taking by clicking.

## Use a large call-to-action button

![[Attachments/b2a6c557b5c38f3fdfb1b17e7ebf57ba_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/05ea80843090e4128c70e19c26cd786b_MD5.jpg]]

Don't be afraid to use a larger CTA button to ensure it's clearly visible to users. Be sure that your button is clearly visible and clickable regardless of screen resolution or [device](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device) type.

Regardless of the screen [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size), device, or resolution, the minimum [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) target should be 9 by 9 mm (approximately 48dp) according to [WCAG](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wcag) 2.0 recommendations. It benefits all users, especially those with vision or motor disabilities.

## Use sufficient contrast

![[Attachments/c185ff3826b875dd59574e9dfaeb3052_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/5fdf2dcc4da65d4284528947865e75c0_MD5.jpg]]

CTA buttons need to stand out on your landing page. If you’re placing a button over an [image](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) or other [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background), be sure that it doesn’t get lost. Using an opaque background for your button is an excellent way to make it visible to users.

**Tip!** When using text over media, the color contrast ratio should be 4.5:1 to comply with the WCAG 2.0 recommendations. Learn other WCAG recommendations on color contrast in the [Color Accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/accessible-colors-417?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Add visual cues to scroll down

![[Attachments/b5022bbfc8c4eb7d3e6726deaf8867f3_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/224b4887f4175b186f2c51a2cec26f2e_MD5.jpg]]

Don’t mislead visitors to your landing page by hiding content. If there’s content below the cut that isn’t immediately apparent across devices and screen sizes, use a visual indicator to let users know it’s there. This helps ensure that users won’t miss critical information.

**Tip!** Ensure that the CTA, main image, and headline are clearly visible without scrolling. 

## Use contextual images

![[Attachments/380717dde24f6fade9ec4abbe67cd490_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/4345d8fe69082cc9c7c2616022336e26_MD5.jpg]]

Support your landing page’s content with relevant images that add to the meaning. Use them to convey or reinforce the information elsewhere on your page.

A picture is worth a thousand words. Images should assist in conveying information to your visitors, even going so far as to explain elements that are difficult to put into words.

## Use urgency to trigger action

![[Attachments/f0d8593f0127b473be7690ab3cb9166f_MD5.jpg]]

Some people make decisions best when there are tight deadlines. Give them too much time to think, and they’ll consider their options forever. Creating urgency, though, can trigger them to take action quickly. They don’t want to miss out on an opportunity and worry that they will. Creating urgency on your landing pages can greatly increase your conversion rates.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup>

Urgency can be a powerful motivator, but when abused can turn into a [dark pattern](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dark-pattern) that unfairly manipulates users into taking an action they would not otherwise take. Letting users know that a deal is only available for a limited time is fine, but creating a false sense of urgency can create high levels of anxiety in some users or lead them to regret an impulse decision later on.

## Social proof increases credibility

![[Attachments/a5a0c7dc15e9a4fe3f4ca11992888d44_MD5.jpg]]

Most people don’t want to be the first to try something new. They want to know that the decision they’re making has already been vetted by others. In fact, 91% of consumers find a product more trustworthy if they get recommendations from people they know. 70% also trust public comments and opinions about products online.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup> 

Social proof offers strong reassurance for people considering making a purchase. Including reviews, ratings, [stats](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/statistics), and other social proof on your landing page can greatly persuade many consumers.

## Use scarcity to trigger action

![[Attachments/856db6dbab622904479ecd955ee1646d_MD5.jpg]]

Scarcity is similar to urgency, but it refers to the amount of an offer remaining rather than the time left. The rarer a product is, the more valuable it becomes. In fact, fear of missing out (FOMO) pushes users to make a purchasing decision as quickly as possible. Showing that there are only five tickets left for a show prompts users to act fast.

While scarcity is a powerful motivator, be careful not to abuse it and turn it into a dark pattern. When done poorly, it can create too much anxiety, especially among neurodivergent users.

## Brand authority builds trust

![[Attachments/6758d7326f3e5366ef84394c7b773d75_MD5.jpg]]

Consumers want to know that they can trust a [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) before making a purchase. Showing brands that use the product (or have reviewed it) is an efficient way to ensure purchasers that the offer is trustworthy. 

If major brands use the product being offered, or well-known media outlets have reviewed it or mentioned it, showcasing that can build a lot of consumer trust. Using logos to reference business partners, clients, or media mentions offers strong reassurance to consumers.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[9]</a></sup>

## Use reciprocity to trigger action

![[Attachments/b2e9478c85685b595feffc37b2c0cb59_MD5.jpg]]

People have a tendency to reciprocate good deeds. Consumers can feel a sense of obligation to do something for you if you do something for them. This principle of reciprocity helps persuade users to buy a product in exchange for some special consideration or bonus.

**Tip!** Free shipping, discounts, special deals, and so on are all examples of reciprocity.

## Design responsively for multiple screens

Considering how many different kinds of devices people access digital products with: [tablets](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tablets), smartphones, desktops, laptops, and even wearable tech like watches. It’s vital that your products work well regardless of the screen size and resolution or device type. 

Make sure that your important landing page elements (headlines and CTAs in particular) are displayed properly whether users are accessing it on a desktop or their smartphone.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[10]</a></sup> [Responsive design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/responsive-design) techniques create [UIs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) that work on virtually any device. They adjust the [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) and other elements of the [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) to fit the screen being used.

## Ensure your page loads quickly

If there’s anything that frustrates people more than slow-moving traffic, it’s probably slow-loading web pages. If it takes longer than a few seconds for your page to load — especially on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) devices — the chance that your users will leave the page increases dramatically. In fact, 53% of mobile users will leave a page if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-11" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[11]</a></sup> 

If you want to retain users, it’s crucial that your landing pages load quickly.

**Tip!** Considering at least half of global users access the web with mobile devices, take a mobile-first approach to make your landing pages faster.

## Add customer support

![[Attachments/6db5b25d4008384c303ac08fdc9bc9c6_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/9f8a4678db8d8e410bf414eee0c42f9e_MD5.jpg]]

Regardless of how thorough the information is on your landing page, some users are bound to still have questions, especially on their first visit. Make it easy for users to ask those questions by including a visible [chat](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chats) widget to convert prospects more quickly.

A word of caution here: sticky chat elements should be desktop [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) only. Due to the luxury of [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) on the desktop, it's less likely a small widget will block any essential content. In contrast, mobile users always complain that sticky chats overlay [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) results, [filters](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters), or worse, the [Checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout) button on e-commerce websites.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[12]</a></sup>

## Avoid distractions and sensory overload

![[Attachments/c0ce11ed30063d48a36ed9d04dc4e277_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/79e67b49236fa36174431b3e103fbbf0_MD5.jpg]]

Cluttering your landing page with extraneous information has a negative impact on how your visitors interact with your page. Keep users’ focus on the primary information by removing everything on the page that doesn’t directly support that information. 

That means getting rid of any secondary offers, distracting imagery that doesn’t directly support the content, and even [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) to other parts of your site in some cases. Keep the landing page simple to increase its impact.
