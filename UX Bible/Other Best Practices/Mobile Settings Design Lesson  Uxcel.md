Generally, each [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) device has the default Settings application, where users can set general settings for each app. However, sending users to the native Settings app to make basic adjustments can be risky. They may get lost and frustrated, fail to fine-tune the proper settings, or simply decide that they don't have time and energy to carry out the task. Eventually, this causes them to leave the app.

Instead of forcing users to do things they aren't familiar with, include important settings directly in the app. For example, many applications allow users to manage [notifications](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications) without leaving the application.

Another option is to guide users to the relevant section of the default Settings app from within the app itself. For example, if users don’t give an app permission to access their location at the initial stage, make sure they can do it later and guide them to where they can do it in Settings.

## Group settings

Seeing a long [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of settings can catch users off guard. They're hard to scan and users may not know exactly what settings they're even looking for.

The [design principle](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-principles) of proximity recommends that related elements should be placed near each other. In turn, unrelated elements are set at a distance. Thus, grouping settings by logical categories helps users browse a page and find the settings they need.

Make sure to include clear category headings that speak to users. Avoid using technical jargon that is only familiar to your team. Instead, take note of the words your audience uses to describe your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) or service.

Designers establish [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) through scale, [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color), [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography), and other techniques. These instruments help indicate the most important part of the [composition](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) and guide users’ eyes toward them. **Hierarchy makes pages easier to scan so users can find what they need faster and complete their tasks without delay.**

Heavily loaded settings pages get easier to scan when you break them down into sections and/or use headings. You can add horizontal line [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) to help users differentiate groups. You can also use [white space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space) dividers that offer a more elegant way to organize [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) blocks without creating clutter.

## Describe settings clearly

Most users are rare visitors to the Settings page, partly because they're scared to encounter technical jargon and intimidating terms. Ultimately, the [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) on the page should be written in plain, familiar language that allows users to access important functionality.

You can name settings categories using nouns alone or combining them with verbs to provide more context. To clear up any doubts, conduct a couple of user [interviews](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview) to hear what words your audience uses to describe your product functionality.

If you're short on budget, create a survey or explore users' vocabulary through conversational [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge). The best places for getting such information include forums, call center queries, reviews on the App Store and Google Play, and comments on a product's page on social media.

More advanced settings often require accurate descriptions that explain what happens if users change them. Place those explanations below the labels of settings and try to keep them concise. If necessary, provide an external [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) to a support page where users can dive deep into details.

**Tip!** Discover the methods of learning about users and their vocabulary in our [User Needs & Research](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ux-writing/user-needs--research-842) lesson.

## Use toggle switches for immediate changes

[Toggle](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/toggles) [switches](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches) are welcome components on a Settings page. Like [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes), they're often used for applying settings changes. In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to checkboxes, toggle switches take immediate effect without users having to press the Submit [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons). Thus, if a page contains other settings that require confirmation, toggle switches should not be used.

The tricky part of adding these controls is to provide unambiguous labels to prevent confusion about the on and off [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states). Instead of using only On and Off labels to identify state changes, change the overall appearance of the toggle to provide more clarity.

## Split settings into basic and advanced

Depending on the app, the Settings page can contain an overwhelming variety of options. Some of them, like notifications or personal data, are more commonly used, while others, like security settings, might be of less interest.

The [progressive disclosure](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/progressive-disclosure) technique helps designers prioritize a list of settings and split them into primary and advanced settings. The first group is visible to everyone and aims to satisfy the needs of average users. The second group is usually hidden under the Advanced Settings link and contains less common parameters that only a small subset of advanced users know how to manage.

Progressive disclosure is all about respect. It helps prioritize the Settings page and first shows only the most relevant options. Novice users feel less intimidated and experience less [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload), while advanced users are free to access more complex settings. Plus, progressive disclosure saves scarce mobile screen [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) and enhances scannability for all types of users.

## Use confirmations for important or destructive actions

[Passwords](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password), [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) addresses, and payment methods fall into the category of sensitive information and an app shouldn't change such data without notifying users and getting their permission. Ask for users' confirmation to update this data via an in-app message, clearly explaining the issue and asking them to confirm this action.

Furthermore, destructive [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) like deleting or deactivating an account also require users' consent via in-app messages and/or email. It allows users who might have accidentally selected an action to undo it and prevent serious issues like data loss. Confirmations may appear annoying to some users but they inform them about what's happening in the app and take care of their data safety.

Keep in mind that users don't read instructions and [alerts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts) word by word, so make sure confirmation [dialogs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs) are concise, direct, and informative. Ideally, users should be able to understand the issue by taking one glance at the heading. Try to sound friendly but avoid inappropriate jokes and goofy or ambiguous headings like "Oops" or "Are you sure?"

## Define common defaults

![[Attachments/a20c82e389f38dab6be824378ceffb10_MD5.jpg]]

Ideally, the default settings should provide the experience users expect when downloading an app and meet their primary goals. That's why user research is a vital step in the product development process. Design decisions based on your team's experiences or preferences have nothing to do with the needs of end-users.

You may guess and build assumptions about what settings will be right for your users, but it's difficult to be accurate. Eventually, products released without user research turn into junk and cost businesses a lot of time and resources.

Instead, you may find a group of users, conduct a few user interviews, and find out how people expect things to work. For example, if it's a messenger app, consider asking the target audience questions like:

-   Do you expect a messenger app to download all shared media to your devices?
-   Do you expect a messenger app to download all shared media with cellular data when Wi-Fi isn't available?
-   Do you expect other app users to see your profile [photo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos) and the time of your last visit?
-   Do you want to share your live location with all your contacts?

**Tip!** Discover ways to understand user needs and wants to craft more compelling and targeted copy in the [Researching User Needs](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/user-needs--research-842?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Include search for longer settings screens

If the list of settings is so long that users need to scroll a few times to find what they need, grouping related settings may not be enough. Consider adding a [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) bar to simplify the process.

Since typing usually increases the [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) cost, include a search auto-suggest that offers users real-time search suggestions within an on-screen [dropdown](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown) [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus).

On the flip side, users often don’t know exactly what settings they need or what they’re called. So, before adding the search functionality, try to minimize and simplify the Settings page first.

## Put destructive items last

Hiding options for deleting an account or even logging out from users is a dark [design pattern](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-patterns). However, due to their destructive nature, they shouldn't be too prominent. Keeping them at the top of the Settings page can result in users accidentally clicking them. It can cause anxiety and require users to do extra work like logging back in. If they forget their credentials, such accidental clicks can result in a lot of added stress and cognitive load.

Putting destructive actions at the bottom of the Settings page and setting them apart with the use of color or [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) reduces the likelihood of accidental clicks. Moreover, it has become a common design pattern, and many users expect these actions to appear last on the Settings page screen.

## Put essential items at the top

The most important and most-used settings should go first. Users find them immediately, allowing them to complete their tasks faster. However, the decision of which settings should be primary should not rely on your assumptions alone.

[Card sorting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/card-sorting) can be a useful [UX](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) [research method](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-methods) when you need to define the order and naming of items.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> In such studies, participants are asked to order settings or organize them into logical groups that make sense to them. This allows you to see what patterns emerge and what settings seem most relevant to users. You can also ask people if settings' names appeal to them and encourage them to suggest their own variants.
