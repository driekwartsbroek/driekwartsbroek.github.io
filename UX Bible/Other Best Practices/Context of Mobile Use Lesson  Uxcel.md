# Context of Mobile Use Lesson  Uxcel
## Number of mobile users

Mobile phones have become so ubiquitous that the chances of coming across someone who doesn’t own a mobile phone are very slim. [Research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA) backs up this assumption by letting us know that as of January 2022, there are nearly 5.3 billion unique mobile phone users in the world, and this number is expected to grow to 5.7 billion by 2025.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

This means that 67% of the world uses a mobile phone today. In just a few years, the number will reach 70% through the addition of 400 million new mobile subscribers, largely driven by technological developments such as 5G and access to faster and cheaper smartphones.

## Smartphone usage

Smartphone usage is growing at a tremendous rate of 5.7% per year.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> According to a GSMA study, 75% of mobile phone users have smartphones. This number is expected to reach 84% by 2025, suggesting that the trend toward smartphones will only increase. Data also shows that by 2025, there will be 7.5 billion smartphone connections. To put that in perspective for you, 4 in 5 people in the world will possess smartphones by 2025.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## American adults with smartphones

Pew Research Center’s Mobile Fact Sheet published in April 2021 shares that while 97% of Americans use a mobile phone, nearly 85% of Americans use smartphones, meaning that there are currently nearly 280 million American smartphone users. That's a 30% increase from the first Pew survey of smartphone ownership conducted in 2011.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

The country with (+1) code is not the leading user of mobile phones, however. That title belongs to China at 1.6 billion users, followed by India at 1.26 billion users.

## Mobile devices and children

According to studies conducted in the United [States](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states), it is highly likely that a child will possess a personal mobile [device](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device) by the time they’re in middle school. In fact, the average age for first-time mobile phone ownership is 12.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup> 65% of children under 13 own smartphones.

However, these are just ownership numbers. When it comes to first-time usage of smartphones, the facts get even more interesting. 12% of children are between 1-2, 28% are under 4, and nearly 40% are under 6 when they first use a smartphone.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

Before you learn how to [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) for smartphone users, it’s imperative to know what kind of devices they use and their [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature). Will your users be predominantly [Android](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/android) users preferring Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, or Xiaomi phones or [iOS](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ios) users who swear by Apple [products](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product)? You’ll have to find that out yourself through [user research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-research), but we’ll give you a global overview of the market share of mobile device manufacturers.

According to a study, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Oppo together have a combined market share of 71% in 2021, making them the top 5 market giants. The global leader in smartphone sales in 2021 was Samsung at 20.1% or 272 million units sold, followed by Apple at 17.14% or 235.7 million units sold.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Always look up the latest statistics before you make any design or product-related decision.

## Time spent on mobile devices

![[Attachments/5fe0fca7dc609341b672cfed35db9768_MD5.jpg]]

From the first mobile phone weighing nearly 2 kilograms to the modern smartphone weighing approximately 200 grams, the paradigm of technology has been permanently altered. Now people can carry their phones with them wherever they go and use them for a wide variety of tasks such as looking up information, making phone calls, taking photographs, sending messages, checking the time, and more. Naturally, in proportion to its utility, the amount of time spent on mobile devices has also increased across the globe.

According to a study, a smartphone user spends nearly 3 hours and 15 minutes using it. This is just the average, however. A significant 20% of users are glued to their screens for more than 4.5 hours daily. What’s more, it was found that a user checks their phone an average of 58 times during any given day!<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup>

## Number of apps

![[Attachments/508729cfe07616920c62ec8cd34c2020_MD5.jpg]]

There are dozens of active apps today, with the Apple App Store at ~1.6 million and the Google Play Store at \`3.5 million apps.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[9]</a></sup> A large number of Android apps are available for free.

One reason for this could be that Android is open-source. It means that anyone can develop apps for it without having to pay a fee or go through a rigorous approval process. This has led to a large number of developers creating apps for Android, which has in turn contributed to the [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) of the Google Play Store.

## Apps per phone

There are billions of apps available for download, but how many of these are users actually downloading? Well, studies suggest that the average number of apps per smartphone is over 80.

However, users do not use them all. In fact, they don’t even use 50% of them regularly. The average user opens no more than 9 apps in a day and 30 apps in a month.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[10]</a></sup>

An average user spends nearly 3 hours a day using a smartphone, but what are they doing in this time exactly?<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-11" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[11]</a></sup> Research says 90% of the time, they’re using apps. It is no surprise, considering the amount of functionality and fun that apps provide these days.

Did you know that there is [an app](https://zombiesrungame.com/) that lets you pretend you’re in a zombie apocalypse mission while going on your daily run? With such innovation and technological advancements, app usage is here to stay and grow.
