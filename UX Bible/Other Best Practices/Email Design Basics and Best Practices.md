# Email Design Basics and Best Practices
## Welcome emails

![[Attachments/cd45757e25d2e790d03ef82338b6ac10_MD5.jpg]]

Welcome emails are the best for cheering new subscribers. Thank them for their trust and make a delightful first impression. Shortly introduce your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) and engage people in exploring it.

Use an [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) verb as your Call to Action. Invite users to complete their profile, create a new project, or start a new lesson.

**Tip!** Avoid overwhelming users with a bunch of useful links and content. Like on the first date, keep it slow and respectful.

## Newsletter emails

![[Attachments/c8874349289454278b715d268e50082b_MD5.jpg]]

Carefully thought-out and on-point newsletter emails provide rich and powerful [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). They usually contain news and product updates that may interest users.

Provide short introductions to keep users intrigued and nudge them to explore more information on the subject.

## Announcement emails

![[Attachments/dd8431cf8fec7246663ed82927e80afa_MD5.jpg]]

The function of an announcement email is to inform and prepare your subscribers for an upcoming change, event, or offer. An announcement email makes a promise. Your email should highlight the usefulness or desirability of what you're announcing to your subscribers.

Announcement emails often include press releases and event invitations. However, topics can range from launching a new product to [communicating](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/communication) a company rebrand.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Avoid being too pushy in such emails to prevent an off-putting or desperate impression.

## Order receipt emails

![[Attachments/e6d326d5cb393ccb33e3aba9820050f4_MD5.jpg]]

Order receipt emails confirm a purchase. Users don't open them often — unless they need to return the product or verify the information. However, the goal of this type of email is to create trust. Send them right away with a jingle of coins to prevent users' concerns and frustration.

**Tip!** Including promotional content, strive for Pareto's 80/20 rule — 80% of transactional and 20% of promotional information.

## Re-engagement emails

![[Attachments/bf50f4bf128b08d549e73ebd56ecfd4a_MD5.jpg]]

Re-engagement emails are designed to win back unengaged subscribers and get them interested in what you offer. You can pinpoint them through engagement metrics such as click rate, open rate (if available), and so on.

Once the first wave of engagement falls, subscribers may lose interest in opening your emails. Besides, some users get busy and forget to check their inboxes. Reengagement emails offer users an incentive to get back to the product.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Incentives to re-engage your users include rewards, product updates, or missed-out opportunities.

## Cart abandonment emails

![[Attachments/1cf3217feb77fefc6a4d2f8e16fcbff9_MD5.jpg]]

Abandoned cart emails mean to re-engage shoppers who left items in their carts without completing [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout). [Research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) shows that almost a third of clicks on abandoned cart emails (29.9%) lead to a recovered sale.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Give your users a nudge and remind them about their unfinished purchases. Time is of the essence — cart abandonment emails sent within the first hour of abandonment perform best. Regardless of why shoppers abandon their [shopping carts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shopping-cart), you have a minimal window to win them back.

## Inverted pyramid layout

![[Attachments/3d71caed60be8c6a7ca135c0545e1faf_MD5.jpg]]

The inverted pyramid [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) is a [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) technique meant to grab users' attention, excite them, and then guide them to take action.

The inverted pyramid has just three parts: headline, details, and the Call to Action. It works like this:

-   **Headline:** The attention-grabbing headline offers up your value proposition or a promise. It's meant to make people curious, so they keep reading.
-   **Catching facts:** The next layer builds anticipation and gives details to back up the value proposition or promise. This is your chance to get readers excited about what you have to offer and how you'll deliver.
-   **CTA:** The final layer is the CTA. This is where you "close the deal." If the first two layers are on point, by the time readers get to the CTA, they should be more than ready to click and convert.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Zigzag layout

![[Attachments/a0d892b70b7a1ed38b2049a888d33ae8_MD5.jpg]]

As the name suggests, the zigzag email layout mirrors the [shape](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes) of the letter "Z," assuming this is the natural user's eye flow. Using [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) and catchy titles, you can create those visual [breakpoints](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/breakpoint) that guide users through the email.

**Tip!** Zigzag layouts are great on desktop but need to collapse so that everything is in the same order on mobile. 

## Single-column layout

![[Attachments/7c12b521ef16bd76c78af7b363f3152c_MD5.jpg]]

Single-columns were the standard for many years. This layout looks great on every [device](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device) and supports skim-reading better than other formats.

[Mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) users significantly benefit from single-column emails. Why should you care? Because in 2022, 4 out of 10 emails are opened through mobile applications.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

Single-column emails are built long and skinny and are intended to be scrolled through quickly. **This is great for several reasons:**

-   Users are used to scrolling on a mobile screen
-   A single-column email template puts information exactly where the user expects it to be

**Tip!** Avoid spreading it wider than 500-600px to prevent horizontal scrolling.

## Use brand elements to identify who you are

![[Attachments/6d607aa3705181a2f59ca7b72d2daf5a_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/6af2792d5a217eed899b578366e6287f_MD5.jpg]]

Use [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) elements in your emails. It's important to show users that you are, in fact, you. Because if they don't recognize where the email is coming from, it's very likely to go to spam. Another reason for using your [logo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/logos) and brand [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) is that it puts users at ease and stirs their interest.

## Use question and exclamation marks sparingly

![[Attachments/482af99cf147da96d865f5977189c184_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/37c29d97016683e0b3a56a1949a3f882_MD5.jpg]]

Experts say that using a question mark on your subject line intrigues users and attracts their attention. At some point, yes, it indeed catches users' eyes. However, 72% of brands report a decrease by 8.1% in click rate on their subject lines containing the question mark.

Further, the findings say that exclamation marks help increase the click rate between 1% to 20% unless you overdo it.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

Question and exclamation marks can serve you well if you master this art. Avoid using generic questions and too many exclamation points, and aim to meet people's expectations of the subject line.

**Tip!** Use exclamation points sparingly. Otherwise, automatic spam filters can place your emails into the Spam folder.

## Avoid aggressive subject line formatting

![[Attachments/3cdb4f4c086cf8bb299ef5d73357b5e2_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/1947db848d8ed6528292a098547da5e1_MD5.jpg]]

Avoid aggressive subject line formatting. **It includes:**

-   All-caps text
-   Overuse of exclamation and question marks
-   Generic marketing phrases
-   Excessive use of [emojis](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/emojis)

Such formatting doesn't increase the opening rates. Instead, it makes your emails feel "marketese" and impersonal.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup> Also, such [styling](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style) looks cheap and disrupts users' trust.

Nielsen Norman Group's research suggests that adding emojis to subject lines increases negative feelings by 26%. Users describe such emails as "boring," "dull," and "frustrating" more often than those that lack emojis.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup>

## Engage users with a preheader

![[Attachments/f10ccb5789985cbc5e1ecc1801e88605_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/7bee0943fbc8b93bae185abc467eeaa8_MD5.jpg]]

The preheader, aka "Johnson Box," is a subject line's partner in crime. It's visible under the subject line, and its goal is to briefly explain the email content.

The subject line and preheader work together to draw users' attention to the topic and encourage them to open the email.

## Address users by their names

![[Attachments/c117c4341b2e61b664269278c5035b7a_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/43caa880e6a7381f4e37927b2560e8cb_MD5.jpg]]

A famous quote from Dale Carnegie is, "A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language." It's also true about addressing users in emails. 

Hubspot studies say that users are more likely to open emails with subject lines containing their first names.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[9]</a></sup>

Using a person's name creates a culture of respect, recognition, and consideration. Take this personalized approach to your [email design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email-design) and use a subscriber's first name in the subject line and the email body.

## Remember about mobile users

![[Attachments/4d90e385f9afdb0cedccf5ec8c44ecf7_MD5.jpg]]

When creating email designs, make sure that they scale well on smaller screens. People use smartphones all the time, and if your email layout gets disproportional or skewed, you risk losing users.

**Tip!** Take the 600px width for a desktop and 320px for mobile as a starting point for email design.

## Use enough white space

![[Attachments/2316cadd4570a9a7657008200ce7cb70_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/5f12a221a247b33662c55a299fbff1e9_MD5.jpg]]

Don't be stingy on [white space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space) in your email layouts. White space isn't just a blank area without content. It creates breathing room for elements, preventing off-putting chaos and clumsiness and making the email easy to scan.

## Emphasize the CTA

![[Attachments/5d9c62f33a8256b4ff99f2cefdf88857_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/3496ebb36f62e85f6d16ee29a40c4d61_MD5.jpg]]

Make the CTA button prominent. A Call to Action is a crucial aspect of any email as it encourages users to take action. If the CTA button doesn't catch their attention, users won't look for it to click it.

To make the CTA button eye-catching, take time to decide on its color, [font](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts), and shape. When writing the [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), use action verbs: buy, get, try out, grab, etc.

**Tip!** Adding enough white space around the CTA enhances its legibility.

## Make links recognizable

![[Attachments/d0a0e551afebb32b3a1422071a3b15c2_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/14ab76499711aeead908cfa67e19d346_MD5.jpg]]

[Link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) styling hasn't changed much over the years. We are used to recognizing underlined; usually blue-colored text as a link. Don't try to reinvent the wheel and use italic or bold emphasis instead — it would only confuse users. 

It's important to make the link text self-explanatory. Avoid vague wording like "click here." All users can benefit from knowing where the link leads, especially screen reader users.

## Include useful information in footers

![[Attachments/533c180f6598e7a12e8216ff4f9cdb84_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/8d6c65223b3024e0dd36ccf8b4b3c7e5_MD5.jpg]]

[Footers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/footers) cement a good impression you achieved with helpful email content and visual appeal. An email footer can include links to your website, contact details, copyright, privacy policy, and social network buttons. And — one of the most critical elements — the Unsubscribe link. Avoid the temptation to hide it from users, as you'd just make those who want to unsubscribe angry. 

**Tip!** Add information on why users receive your emails alongside the Unsubscribe option.

## Let users unsubscribe if they want

![[Attachments/389299578df5fc2c43cdd1f938d3562c_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/2a99e5cbc193eff6c06a7c278a38ec4e_MD5.jpg]]

We know losing your subscribers is a heartbreaking experience. However, fight the urge to hide the Unsubscribe link — it's against all rules. Making it prominent enough and easy to find, you demonstrate transparency and build a bridge of trust between the product and your users.
