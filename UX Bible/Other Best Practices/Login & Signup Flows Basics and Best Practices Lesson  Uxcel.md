Don’t add extra steps to your signup process. Keep it to a single [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages), with a minimum number of [fields](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) required to set up an account. The longer the form is, or the more steps it takes to complete it, the more likely users will get frustrated or hit a roadblock during the process.

**Tip!** Don't make users navigate to a new page to sign up when you can embed the form in their current page.

## Make signing up simple and fast

Let’s face it: people generally don’t enjoy filling out forms, and signup forms are no different. Making the signup process faster and easier can increase your [conversion rates](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/conversion-rate). Eliminate any unnecessary inputs in your signup form and you’ll find users are more likely to complete the process.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Use separate pages for login and signup

Failing to differentiate between login and signup may create confusion for users. They could end up trying to log in with the registration form or vice versa. Frustrating your users definitely won’t lead to higher conversion rates. To prevent this, use separate pages for logging in and signing up.

Make sure users understand how to [switch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches) between pages. Place the Don't have an account? Sign Up text below the form, so it's easy to spot but doesn't steal users' attention from the main [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). 

## Keep Sign Up/Log In options nearby

Sometimes we accidentally click “Sign Up” when we meant to log in, and vice versa. Make sure the forms [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) to one another so that it’s easy for users to switch to the other function if they make a mistake. The goal is to facilitate user progress through the [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) they're trying to take as seamlessly as possible.

## Be clear and concise with password requirements

Requiring strong passwords helps protect users’ data and acts as the primary line of defense against unauthorized access to personal information. Make it easy for users to choose a [password](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password) that meets those requirements by including a checklist right under the input and ticking them as users fulfill each one.

## Allow signing up with social media profiles

Nearly 80% of users favor social logins for any website. That’s good news, since nearly 90% of users are frustrated by constantly having to set up new accounts.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> 

Social login lets users use their existing Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, or other social media logins to create an account on your site. It drastically speeds up the registration process and greatly reduces the risk that they’ll forget their login information when returning to your site.

**Tip!** Social logins can provide you with key information about users (with their permission) such as name, email address, or a profile photo.

## Use branded social buttons

![[Attachments/ccb2bd0a28029bcf38a5a90a9cc2a763_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/ab0c822c37f273634ceeab063d237147_MD5.jpg]]

When using social logins, use the [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) and [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) of the platforms they’re integrated with. It makes them more recognizable to users and builds additional trust. Most social networks have brand guidelines that tell you exactly how to use (and how not to use) their [assets](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/assets).

If you still decide to use your custom social buttons, make sure to add the relevant brand [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons).

## Make a descriptive welcome page

![[Attachments/a7161bf8dfb2b18914b64bd27eac96b2_MD5.jpg]]

You need to give users a compelling reason to sign up for your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product). Make it clear to them what the advantages of creating an account are to increase the likelihood that they’ll create an account. Welcome screens are an ideal place to remind them of the benefits they’ll get by signing up.

## Make your buttons visible

![[Attachments/6ff22aa0ca48d6e60ff3b1edee9976cf_MD5.jpg]]

Depending on the product, login and signup pages may be the first steps of the user journey, and likely among the most important steps. Put the buttons for them in a highly visible spot, such as the site’s [header](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/header). This makes them easy to find and act upon.

**Tip!** The main brand color can come in handy here to draw users' attention to the Log In and Sign Up buttons.

## Avoid similar-looking wording for button labels

![[Attachments/56515476c3a9345af38647d7cca983c9_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/5b13dae8dfa83246381f9ee450a418f3_MD5.jpg]]

When choosing your [CTA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), avoid using similar-looking words like “sign in” and “sign up.” Users don’t always fully read labels when taking an action, and using labels that start with the same word could result in them clicking on the wrong CTA. Instead, use “log in” and “sign up” (or “register”) to make each action recognizable at a glance.

## Utilize button hierarchy

![[Attachments/c9378f2f64d5a73d3eb3ec955f8323d3_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/2f5cbc9fc6274266b462df68bebe4b14_MD5.jpg]]

Logging in and signing up are similar actions, but they’re obviously not the same. Accidentally clicking on one when you meant to click the other is frustrating. Be sure to use button [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) to distinguish between the two on your login and signup forms. It'll help prevent users from clicking on the wrong button — wasting their time and creating frustration.

## Allow multiple login options

![[Attachments/d94ce04f3b3ae14fc835bf956e48278f_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/20f56c3490670488bde7a7bba3eb5aff_MD5.jpg]]

Allowing users multiple options to log in can save a lot of frustration. Remembering a unique username can be much more difficult than remembering an [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) address. But some users may have multiple email addresses, so adding the option to use a phone number to log in can simplify the process even more.

## Simplify the password input

![[Attachments/854c00c71dd78d3e6fa77eacb9a9a754_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/569b7293881d5dbe8b3ab4fdb92b6e32_MD5.jpg]]

If you want users to keep using your product, make it as easy to use as possible. That means removing unnecessary inputs, such as confirming a password when logging in. Keep the essential inputs (username and password on a login screen, for example) and drop the rest. The simpler the process, the more likely users are to keep coming back.

## Allow the option to show password

![[Attachments/791b76c2a9459f75f03a607dca2c92e7_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/39e8008a25ab4fde81c8b587eacf116a_MD5.jpg]]

It’s so easy to make a mistake when inputting a password, especially on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device). Add the option to show a password so that users can make sure they typed what they meant to. An eye icon in or near the password field is the most common way to let users do this. Be sure that it works both ways and allows them to hide their password again.

**Tip!** Always hide the password by default.

## Allow users to stay logged in

![[Attachments/5d5af8559fb269b035fc5205f91e951f_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/120237afe2564023bca7e4bb02e26297_MD5.jpg]]

Having to type your credentials every time you visit a website can get annoying. Some users would likely rather stay logged in, or at least have their username and password remembered. Reduce frustration by giving them that option.

On sites where staying logged in could be a security issue (such as banking websites), allow users to at least have their username remembered to [speed](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/speed) up the login process.

**Tip!** When security is a major priority, obscuring part of the username with asterisks makes the login process faster while also protecting users.

## Prevent user errors

![[Attachments/d95a34c2bf5a27640c1896954022c446_MD5.jpg]]

Have you ever typed your password and gotten an error message only to realize the Caps Lock was on? All users make mistakes, and good systems should notify people in advance to prevent [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors). [Warning](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/warning) users that their Caps Lock is on before they enter their password makes the login experience much smoother and prevents confusion.

## Use input autofocus

![[Attachments/4cbb06a532352282842d08bbdfd3e029_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/6c32cfd090b6408cfdc4299e477152ac_MD5.jpg]]

The username or email input field is usually the first step when logging in or signing up for any platform. Apply autofocus to it to show your users where to start. Make sure it's easily visible to give users a clear visual cue.

## Keep inputs visible and accessible

![[Attachments/5a97136a6720cc5629f514569117b046_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/fd53316cfc075f62786e0d6442d13c25_MD5.jpg]]

While designing signup forms for mobile devices, always think of [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards) placement — make sure it doesn't overlap with the form. The active input should always stay visible.
