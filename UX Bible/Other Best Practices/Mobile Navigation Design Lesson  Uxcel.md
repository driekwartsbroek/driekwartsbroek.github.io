**The top navigation bar came to mobile from desktop [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design). It's a bar that [lists](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) the main navigational options at the top of the screen.** It usually doesn't contain more than five [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) — unless it's a scrollable [carousel](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/carousels).

The top navigation bar is often used in combination with other ways of navigation such as [tabs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tabs) or bottom navigation. The top bar conveys to users that the links it contains are essential — especially if they remain visible as the user scrolls down.

**The top navigation bar also has its downsides:**

-   It works well only when there are relatively few navigation options.
-   It takes up valuable space above the fold.
-   Users need to change their grip to access it.

## Bottom navigation bars

**The bottom navigation bar has the same primary links as the top navigation bar but is placed at the bottom of the screen.** Its location allows users to tap the links with their thumbs without changing the grip, which improves the [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) of the entire [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product).

Just like the top bar, the bottom navigation bar has 3-5 destinations for quick access. Apple's [Human interface guidelines](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/human-interface-guidelines) suggest that the [tab bar](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tab-bar) appears at the bottom of a screen.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Tabs

There's a lot of overlap between the terms "tab" and "navigation bar." The fact that tabs can appear both at the top and bottom of the screen only adds to the confusion.

Most experts agree that tabs can only be used to separate content into sections and not for [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions). Other distinctions are more contradictory.

Some argue that tabs always stay visible on the screen, and navigation bars disappear when users scroll down.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> Another thought is that navigation bars contain unrelated options while tabs have a theme.

In any case, these two navigation patterns are very similar. They are both suited for sites and apps with few navigation options since it's hard to fit more than 5 options on the screen horizontally and still keep an optimum touch-target [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size).

On [Android](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/android), tabs usually appear at the top, whereas [iOS](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ios) apps put them at the bottom of the [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages).

## Hamburger menus

**The hamburger menu refers to any menu that has main navigation options hidden behind an icon.** The most commonly used [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) are the hamburger icon (3 little horizontal lines) and the Menu [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels).

Hamburger menus have several advantages. They can contain many options in a tiny space and easily support submenus.

A significant disadvantage is that such [menus](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) are less discoverable.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> While mobile users are familiar with hamburger menus, many still don't intuitively open them.

Hamburger menus are best suited for content-heavy, browsing sites and apps where users care less about navigating to specific site sections and mostly just browse what's presented to them.

If you decide to use a hamburger menu, think about supporting navigation in other ways. For example, you could make the [IA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/information-architecture) structure of your site more discoverable by increasing cross-section links.

## Cards

[UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) [cards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) look like physical cards, usually with physical boundaries and square or rounded edges. They come in a variety of [shapes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes) and sizes.

A UI card usually consists of the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background), an [image](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images), and a few [containers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container). These containers hold items such as an image, a [CTA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), a title, or a subtitle.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

Card UI designs have many advantages. They are intuitive, straightforward, and make content more scannable. Cards can easily be personalized and adapted to different screen sizes — making them a great option for responsive apps.

## Gesture-based navigation

**Gesture-based navigation relies on [gestures](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/gestures): swiping, touching, dragging (both horizontally and vertically), and zooming in and out.**

This type of navigation has been popularized by apps like Tinder. In the app, users can swipe right to like someone and swipe left to reject them.

Gesture-based navigation creates an interactive and dynamic [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience). When done well, the gestures feel intuitive, and even inexperienced users quickly get them right.

**Tip!** Make sure that gesture-based navigation isn’t the only navigation option.

## 3D touch

3D [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) is an Apple technology based on pressure sensitivity. Users apply certain pressure levels to the touchscreen, [setting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/settings) off a navigation [shortcut](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shortcuts). The system then shows the critical actions for the selected app. This [feature](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) usually works in native apps and rarely in [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) apps.

Another common use for 3D touch is content previewing. When dealing with a list of content options, like an [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) inbox or a list of articles, this can be a good way to give the user a preview.

**Tip!** Make sure that 3D touch isn't the only way to access central features. Users should be able to find the primary features without discovering the 3D touch option.

**The navigation hub is a page, usually the homepage, listing all the navigation options.** To navigate to a new location, users have first to go back to the hub and then use one of the options listed there.

This type of navigation works well in task-based websites and apps. A common [use case](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/use-case) is airline websites. A mobile homepage might offer options like buying tickets, checking for a flight, or reading the related information. It's unlikely that users would need to both check and buy a ticket in a single session, so they don't need to return to the homepage often.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Circle menus

**Circle menus are similar to hamburger menus — a list of options hides behind an independent actionable button. The difference is that in circular menus it's usually located at the bottom of the screen and the options it reveals are circular.**

The pictorial circle menu is a great way to express a company's [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) identity and create a lasting impression on users. You could see an example of such a menu in the older version of the Tumblr app. It presented the primary functions across the bottom bar, and the blue pencil action button stood out from the other keys, making it intuitive.

## Account for hand positions

When designing mobile apps, it's crucial to consider the size of people's hands and fingers and their positioning.

Make links and buttons big enough for most people to be able to tap them successfully on the first try. The general rule of thumb is to provide a minimum 10mm size to all buttons.

Spacing between elements is equally as important as touch targets. Add enough space so that users don't tap on random elements near the ones they actually aim for.

## Consider users' needs when choosing navigation

When deciding on navigation options, consider why users come to your website or app.

When people come for content — to read news, check stock data, or watch funny cat videos — they want to get to the information right away. In this case, less intrusive navigation like the hamburger menu works best.

Other web experiences benefit from having a navigation hub on their home page. The hub works well for task-based products, where users need to book a flight, find a fitness routine, or enroll in a course.

Considering your users' needs will help you strike the optimal balance between content and navigation accessibility.
