Less is more. Overloading users with tons of features and various benefits within a pricing [table](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tables) intensely increases the [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload). The more options users have, the more overwhelmed they feel, and the longer it takes for them to make a choice. Further, largely due to choice paralysis, users feel discouraged from purchasing a more advanced plan.

Ask your users what features sound more appealing and cut off the less prominent ones. Don't forget to add enough [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) between options to make them stand out and enhance [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility).

**Tip!** Add visual accents via fonts, color, and graphic elements to aid users in comparing and scanning pricing plans.

## Duplicate primary buttons

If tables are quite heavy and involve vertical scrolling, consider duplicating primary [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), like Upgrade Plan or Get Premium, at the top and the bottom of the table. This way, you eliminate extra movements users may need to reach the button.

## Communicate the differences

Craving something sweet, you will likely focus on differences — cold or warm, crunchy or soft — to choose between options. Apply the same approach to the pricing table, pointing out distinct features between plans rather than similar ones. To do that right, place distinguishing features at the top of the table, so that users can scan and decide more quickly.

Some companies make it hard for users to compare plans, forcing them to select one based on the price only. While it may work, being honest with your customers is a much stronger foundation for building long-term loyalty.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Make sure the feature list fits on a single page and isn't too long. 

## Emphasize the content thoughtfully

When it comes to choosing between pricing plans, it's hard to predict users' behavior. However, some common strategies may help you decide on which plan to emphasize:

-   **The middle plan.** It usually goes after a free plan, is cheaper than the most expensive one, and users tend to select something in between.

-   **The plan that fits most needs.** Do your [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge), speak to your users, and learn which plan is the most beneficial for users. Adding the Top Choice [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) will help other users make their minds faster.

-   **The plan that offers a free trial.** It's no secret that everyone loves free stuff. Choosing to highlight a free plan shows users that you are focused on their interests, not just making money.

Use the enlarged [font](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts) for prices and primary action buttons that stand out. Adjust [font size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/font-size) and weight, apply a distinct [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color), and add checkmarks to draw a user's attention to specific areas and maintain visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy).

**Tip!** Don't overdo in adding too many visuals and highlights. When everything seems important, nothing is important.

## Strive for a legible and simple style

When there's too much information on a page, the human brain fails to sort out essential and less essential [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). Plus, attempts to find necessary data going around in circles have little value. Strive for a simplistic design with no visual clutter that distracts users from their primary goal.

## Illustrate the difference

Graphics in pricing tables are not only for visual appeal but also for [communicating](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/communication) each plan's message and its features. A picture is worth a thousand words, and users should understand the plan value and difference at a glance with the help of [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) or [illustrations](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/illustration).

Illustrations are also a perfect [tool](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) for increasing user engagement. Another way to do so is to add some playfulness to make users stay longer on a pricing page. Think of adding buttons, drag & drop functionality, [sliders](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/sliders), or other interactive elements that engage users in [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction).

## Use meaningful pricing plan names

![[Attachments/5913630337e688e4116b93ea8422894a_MD5.jpg]]

Plan names should help users make a choice, while ambiguous labels like "Standard" or "Advanced" don't bring any value. Furthermore, spend some time creating clear, concise descriptions of each plan to guide users toward a conscious decision even faster. 

## Limit options

Offering too many plans is rarely a good pattern. People like the idea of having a lot of freedom of choice, but in practice, they will spend hours [sizing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) their opportunities and, eventually, won't pick anything. Help users to choose by limiting their options.

You may opt for a safe choice and settle on 3 plans, but it will still be a guess. Alternatively, you may conduct [user testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-testing) and learn what number of pricing plans is satisfying for your audience.

**Tip!** To limit plans that are overly descriptive, focus more on the value users get from this plan and what may push them towards a purchase.

## Reduce friction

When it comes to payments, fears and doubts arise: "What if I don't receive what I expect?" Adding FAQs, testimonials, and case studies can help reduce friction and cover concerns about each plan.

Find participants from your target audience willing to share their fears, doubts, and uncertainties about their experience with your product's pricing page. Forums, comments, and reviews may also give answers to the most common questions if you don't have an opportunity to talk to users or are on a budget. 

Additionally, you may offer free trials or other money-back guarantees. Users feel more secure knowing they can return their money if they don't like a product or service.

**Tip!** What to do with uncommon questions? Advise users to contact you or direct them to a live chat.

## Provide quick help

Live chats help users get professional help right here. Users have time to think before putting their questions in writing, and they can multitask while talking to a manager. Besides, such conversations usually consume less time than getting support over [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email).

In addition to the live chat function, consider including a phone number on the page for users who prefer calling to texting. Websites and services that offer multiple ways to contact customer service appear more credible to users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Adding a live chat to the pricing table, you make introverts' lives so much more delightful.

## Show plans to meet users' needs

Interestingly, the studies by CXL Institute show people are more eager to choose things they saw in the beginning, aligned in left-right order.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> Some designers and marketers get worried that high-priced plans go unnoticed and fall back on this [dark pattern](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dark-pattern). They change the order of plans, placing them from left to right and from expensive to cheap. Users viewing the highest prices first consider the rest of the plans as less attractive.

We don't recommend using this pattern as it destroys users' trust and your company's reputation in general. A more well-thought-out long-term decision is to arrange pricing plans depending on the benefits and features that can actually help users to complete their goal.

## Make the CTA stand out

![[Attachments/a081903735fd9d6ab0ff1c4a683be761_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/95fa5ffbaf66dbe8db21304d93a4631a_MD5.jpg]]

The [CTA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) is the hallmark of the pricing table. It should stand out and contain a direct [command](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/commands) to action. Try to sound more specific and value-oriented when choosing button labels. In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to ambiguous "Buy Now," "Get Pro" or "Choose Team" commands sound more appealing and emphasize what users get when they click the button. Make sure the button is easy to spot and doesn't overlap with other elements on a page.

**Tip!** Button labels should carry value for users. Avoid too generic commands, such as "submit," that only confuse users.

## Enhance credibility

![[Attachments/8b81dcead9f6b796d5be81b06b1d66f8_MD5.jpg]]

Seeing testimonials from other people or companies works like a stamp of approval for your audience. Testimonials inspire confidence in users and motivate them into buying your product or services.

**Tip!** High profile logos yield more user engagement than low profile ones. However, any social proofs are better than nothing.
