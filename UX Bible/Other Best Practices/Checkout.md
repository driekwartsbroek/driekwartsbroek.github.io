One of the most common reasons users abandon the checkout process is because it takes too long with no end in sight. [Progress trackers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/progress-trackers) are a surefire way to keep your users committed to the checkout process, especially if it is long and requires multiple [inputs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) from them.

It doesn’t matter if your process spans one page or multiple pages, when more than a few steps are involved, give users an outline of what to expect using a progress tracker. This will let them know how far they’ve come and how many steps are left before the purchase is completed.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Moreover, breaking down [forms](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) into multiple steps or pages makes them more digestible and reduces the cognitive load required to fill them out.

Another single-page alternative to progress trackers is fitting all the steps of the checkout process under an [accordion](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accordions) [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) on one page. As users complete each step, they’ll scroll down and move on to the next one while knowing exactly how many steps are left.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Remove distractions

The point of any checkout page is to get users to complete a purchase. Anything that steers them away from this goal is a distraction — think top [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) bar or a [footer](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/footers) with [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links).

Keep the number of links you have on the checkout page to a minimum to prevent users from leaving the page. This means only adding what is absolutely necessary — for example, a link to live [customer support](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/support) to answer any questions or concerns they may have before making a purchase.

Allow users to modify the number of items by adding or reducing them within the checkout page itself. Needless to say, the checkout page should also be clear of any advertisements or unnecessary pop-ups.

**Tip!** A great alternative to promo links is copy-paste promo codes that don't redirect users to another page.

## Use a single-name field

![[Attachments/27a7a0ddf9bdf026cc1f73bc2150f25d_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/1a08a5625762c4590fdcbb4323da6287_MD5.jpg]]

The longer your checkout page, the higher the risk of users abandoning it. According to a study, using too many form fields can intimidate and scare off users from making a purchase.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> The first step to cutting down this number is using a single name input field. No first name and last name, just one “full name” field.

This is because most people tend to think of their names as a single entity, and typing it into two different fields causes unnecessary friction. Keep in mind that the lesser effort your users have to put into checking out, the more likely they are to complete their purchase.

## Ensure address hierarchy

![[Attachments/7f901b64b6c4b25dc5c2906191dae52d_MD5.jpg]]

When dealing with international or even national shipping, it makes sense to put the country/ [state](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) name first for checkout. Many fields, such as address or phone number, are region-specific, so knowing the country/state ensures you only ask for relevant information.

Since address formats could be different in different regions, provide users with [tools](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) to [speed](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/speed) up the process. Indicate the meaning of each required input with a [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) and example [placeholder](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/placeholder) text, such as street name or apartment number.

## Provide inline validation

![[Attachments/57611fea132fcc773d8f4e6e904a2fed_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/0f7544e80104078e04066995f7dcb66a_MD5.jpg]]

Any form that waits until after a user clicks on Submit to point out any [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) is likely to be abandoned by them. To prevent this, offer inline validation on every input field of your form so that users know immediately when they make a mistake and what they should do to correct it. Don’t just flag failed validations, but also indicate successfully completed ones as well. It's a huge time saver, reduces friction, and imparts trust in the system.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Indicate erroneous and successful inputs using prominent, contrasting colors (usually red and green) and a relevant icon.

## Write clear error messages

![[Attachments/1fe868de63902ae494a44faa8f82c46b_MD5.jpg]]

It’s not uncommon for products to go out of stock or for server errors to happen while users are adding things to their carts. Errors are inevitable in any product — what really matters is how helpful you are towards guiding your users out of these error states.

According to the Nielsen Norman Group, the principles that go into a good error message are pretty straightforward: keep the language explicit, concise, polite, precise, constructive, and human.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

Errors can also occur on the part of users — for example, a mistyped postal code or a non-existent [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) address. In this case, avoid blaming users for their mistakes and let them know what went wrong and how to fix it. Better yet, make your [microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy) on form labels, placeholder text, and CTAs unmistakably clear, in turn cutting down the chances of errors happening.

## Enable autofill

![[Attachments/61fbb249cea9d9267a0c429707ea8f53_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/ff44e8993e6b6ff405243d66e12b9593_MD5.jpg]]

Whenever possible, allow users to [autofill](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/autofill) payment details. Use browser autofill of saved data for all common form fields such as name, address, email id, phone number, and [password](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password). Enable browser-saved data to be used for [card](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) details as well, in addition to providing options like credit card scanning and quick UPI integration.

You can also make things easier for your users by enabling autofill when your payment gateway requires them to type in a one-time password (OTP) that they receive in their inbox. This decreases [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) costs and protects users from bothersome toggling between pages.

## Allow guest checkout

![[Attachments/f7521f9ab465515b940fcef4f7cc0356_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/5f1d245f915c68c846c7c76f05668262_MD5.jpg]]

Studies suggest that delaying account creation for users is in your best interest. An immediate request to sign up can be intimidating and put users off.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup> To speed up purchases without having your users run away, allow them to checkout as guests. Ensure the “checkout as a guest” option is the most prominent option on the account-selection step and that users can easily find it.

**Tip!** Enable one-click social sign-up and sign-in to make registration and logging in hassle-free.

## Provide real-time customer support

![[Attachments/15e0470975a2769dda2f807e5908a840_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/f57407dc7e6dd7d564ddf0ec422a03df_MD5.jpg]]

No matter how clear you intend for your checkout process to be, there’s bound to be a misunderstanding or two among users. In this situation, you can either leave them to rely on your impersonal FAQ pages, or you can provide them with real-time professional support. The difference between the two is that the latter is more likely to get you a successful sale. Leave multiple links for users to ask for support via call or live [chat](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chats) as they prefer.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup>

## Localize for different markets

![[Attachments/41b942bf7db03243cef08ac713cd1877_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/90cfa3881033182a63643ef492f6008c_MD5.jpg]]

When selling internationally, keep in mind local differences and use different formats for different countries. It concerns units of measurement, phone numbers, addresses, and of course, currencies. This not only shows respect for users but also prevents errors and reduces friction.

## Summarize the order details

![[Attachments/db1ac0c533eab3e6f69f2d0e3bf125e7_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/88fdda1803ee63ba8919881477a4e600_MD5.jpg]]

Add a summary section to your checkout page with details of every product in the cart: product [image](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images), quantity, product page link, most relevant [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature), and [price](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/price) included. Not doing so and only displaying the final price will cause users to trust your website less — so let them know what they’ll be paying for with full transparency.

Displaying the estimated delivery time alongside each product in the cart is a plus.

**Tip!** Make promo codes prominent and easy to copy. It may also be a good idea to include the promo code option at the beginning of the checkout flow. Upon viewing the promo price, users will be more likely to continue through the checkout flow.

## Allow different payment options

When users trust your website enough to share their payment details and make a purchase, reward them by making it easy, trustworthy, and seamless. Provide as many payment links as possible. That being said, offering more methods is costly. Prioritize the most popular methods first, expanding the options as your business grows, and scaling becomes feasible.

According to Baymard Institute studies, 9% of users abandon a website due to the lack of convenient payment methods.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[9]</a></sup> Your users are one step away from the purchase — give them the whole range of payment options, including Apple Pay or Google Pay.

## Provide order confirmation after payment

![[Attachments/8afe3a9f70b8e4b2d93941d1db3b9593_MD5.jpg]]

Don’t leave your users hanging after they’ve placed their order and made the payment. Let them know you’ve received it and are processing it with a confirmation screen. **Don’t forget to send out a detailed confirmation email that covers the:**

-   Order summary
-   Final price and cost breakdown
-   Estimated date of delivery
-   Order tracking details (if applicable)
-   Customer support details
-   Registration option for guest checkouts

**Tip!** Making the checkout experience better is a long and ongoing process, and these best practices are only a first step. Don’t forget to test your page with your target audience and iterate until you arrive at a design that works best for your product.

## Simplify card number input

![[Attachments/34f255398fc714329c241fdee3e6db41_MD5.jpg]]

It's crucial to make the checkout process as smooth and intuitive as possible so users can effortlessly reach the end of their checkout journey.

Use smart defaults and foresee potential errors that users might make. Once users select their country, make the system fetch the corresponding currency — it saves time and effort and helps prevent mistakes. By not confusing users with prices, you foster trust and create a positive impression about your [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding).

Another best practice that can be applied to filling in the card number input is to allow the system to detect the card type automatically. It can be implemented by checking the first four digits so users don’t have to select it manually.

**Tip!** Ensure the debit/credit card number layout follows the input mask format. It automatically formats spaces in the card number field, making it easier for users to check what they are typing.

## Add visual signs of a secure payment

When it comes to sharing their payment information with e-commerce sites, users feel edgy and check websites' credibility 100 times before purchasing anything.

Baymard Institute's [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) study reveals that 18% of users have abandoned a checkout flow during the last 3 months because they "didn't trust the site with their credit card information."<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[10]</a></sup>

Although most users form an opinion about a site's security based on their "gut feeling," [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) can reinforce this feeling of trust by ensuring the website has the following:

-   **Security [badges](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/badges) or trust seals.** "SSL seals" issued by SSL certificate vendors like Norton, Thawte, Trustwave, Geotrust, or Comodo denote secure [communication](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/communication) between a browser and site. Furthermore, trust seals like Google Trusted Store, BBB Accredited, and TRUSTe indicate to users the business is legit and that they can trust it.
-   **A padlock [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) and HTTPS protocol.** The HTTPS protocol provides a layer of encryption that can help ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) browser of users and a website. Such a tiny detail as a padlock icon can also provide enough visual security cues to increase users' perception of security.

**Tip!** Solid visual design of a website also inspires trust and makes users feel fewer security concerns.
