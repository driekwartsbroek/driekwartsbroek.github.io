## Chronological feed

![Chronological feed](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/chronological-feed-1602932656361/a-1656416146160.jpg)

Chronological feed sorts events in order of when they were created, usually from newest to oldest. This is the oldest and most traditional type of feed. A purpose of such a feed is to present a timeline of events.

Nowadays, not many apps use purely chronological feeds. Avoid a chronological feed if you know that you’ll want to eventually [switch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches) to an algorithm-based feed. Sudden changes like that will upset users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Chronological feeds are best when real time is a core component of your app. For example, if you want to display users' activities or places they visited during a specific period.

## Ranked feed

Ranked feeds use algorithms to decide what content to display to users. For most applications, the user doesn’t care about the exact time an activity was posted. Ranked feeds take other factors into account besides the time it was created.

Some common examples include popularity, featured, promoted, and editorial.

**Tip!** Use ranking in apps with more than a few dozen activities.

## Aggregate notifications

Aggregated notifications are logically grouped. Aggregating notifications prevents information overload for all users, but this [feature](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) is crucial for power users. "256 people followed you today" is a much better notification than a user's phone buzzing 256 times. Collapse the notifications based on the time, type of notification, etc.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Help users to personalize their feed

Make it easy for users to personalize their feed. Suggesting profiles to follow is a simple way to encourage users to explore your product and get them hooked. How to create personal recommendations?

**Here are some ideas of what to include:**

• Profiles that users may know or their friends already follow

• Profiles that may be of interest to your users

• Profiles that are the most famous and influential among users

## Avoid visual clutter

When designing feeds, go for clean and simple [designs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) and avoid visual clutter. Simple UIs allow users to quickly scan content, which is their primary goal. Too many elements, inconsistent [fonts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts), or excessively long [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) distract users. 

Each feed entry may have a lot of custom data associated with it. As a [designer](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer), your job is to ensure this only the necessary data is displayed and the UI stays uncluttered.

**Tip!** Simplicity isn't only about the visual appeal — it reduces the cognitive load on users.

## Maintain text legibility

As the primary purpose of a feed is to facilitate content consumption, it's essential to make the text accessible. Make sure all text is legible so that users don't need to squint to understand what's happening. When in doubt, double-check your text [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) with an [accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accessibility) [tool](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools).

## Shorten timestamps

![[Attachments/be5697de0e35e48afbb9100f0537b593_MD5.jpg]]

Abbreviate timestamps to the bare minimum. Their [role](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/roles) is not to provide an exact time. Instead, consider them a broad indicator of how long ago the activity occurred. Timestamps are a tertiary feed feature, so avoid emphasizing them too much.

**Tip!** In most cases, you can omit "ago" — users will understand what "3h" means.

## Offer recommendations

Keep users always engaged by avoiding a blank feed. On average, you have 3-7 days after the app's installation to get users hooked, according to Ankit Jain, the former Director of Engineering for Google.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> In what situation can users see an empty feed? It could be a new user who hasn't followed anyone yet, or there is no fresh news.

One of the ways to engage users is to make sure to design "users to follow" as a part of your [onboarding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/onboarding). Then you can populate the feed with some of their recent entries. Another option is to suggest looking at popular channels, inviting friends, or updating their profiles.

## Add a CTA to empty states

If for some reason you can't give users suggestions on who to follow, explain how they can fill their feed and add an actionable [CTA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action). Feeds are a powerful habit-forming instrument and an empty feed can fulfill its function.

**Tip!** Take the pressure off by using a friendly tone and providing a helpful suggestion on what to do.

## Provide only the necessary controls

![[Attachments/8a06ceabf8f710aaf6eb7deee354cbfe_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/e7516e70c3e83a182bda7180a9d65341_MD5.jpg]]

Provide users only the most common controls on the activity feed, such as a comment, like, or share. There is no need to overwhelm them with a bunch of unnecessary options. Doing so keeps engagement controls focused.

**Tip!** If you really need a lot of options, you can bury them inside a More icon (kebab).

## Add visual signs of feed refresh

Waiting in line or attending a meeting can be boring, so we tend to refresh our feeds a lot. When refreshing the feed, it's important to properly display a [loading](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/loading) indicator. A proper [animation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/animation), such as a spinning circle or spinning wheel, can give a nice comforting feeling and inform users about what's going on.
