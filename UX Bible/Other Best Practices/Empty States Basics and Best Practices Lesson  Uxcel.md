Empty state pages are just a part of the [user flow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow). They happen when it's the first use, users cleared data, or there's some system [error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors).

What looks like a complete dead-end can turn into a sure win. A unique illustration in tandem with appropriate wording is a great way to make a nice first impression and encourage users to take [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) instead of intimidating them with a "dead" [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition).

**Tip!** Empty states provide an excellent opportunity to add some personality to your product.

## Basic empty state

![[Attachments/168a3f757a30fabc407579dd45f0edb5_MD5.jpg]]

Basic empty states simply announce that the page has nothing to show — yet. Even without a [CTA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), you can provide a hint on what users can do to continue their journey.

**Tip!** Always suggest something — "refresh the page", at the very least.

## Action empty state

An action empty state should encourage users to take action. Make sure the Call-to-Action button corresponds to the message in your text. If you would like to offer users something else — reading [documentation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/documentation), for example — put a [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) in the copy.

## Don't go overboard with images

Empty states shouldn't be empty, don't get us wrong — they do occur when there's yet no [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) to show. However, you can use this chance to engage users in exploring your product. Plus, you can show your creativity. No need to go the extra mile — pleasant and straightforward [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) are enough to enhance the words and direct users to actions.

**Tip!** Make sure images are consistent with your brand identity. If it's an app for construction engineers, a frisky kitty for an empty state may be off-key.

## Use relevant illustrations

The right combination of words and visuals can do magic for empty state pages. People process visual information 60,000 times faster, and proper images can help users get the message and lighten the mood.

For instance, if you [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) a booking app for flight tickets, instead of a blank and boring "You have no flights to show" page, you can accompany it with an airplane waiting for take-off.

**Tip!** Avoid using images at all if you lack the resources to create them. Wrong images can mislead and confuse users.

## Use descriptive microcopy

![[Attachments/6d3fb07294fa3b55d94235d539e7d6a7_MD5.jpg]]

Tell users what they can do rather than what they can't. And, of course, stay positive. A message like "You have 0 friends" can bluntly hurt someone's feelings. Try to provide an uplifting and encouraging message to help users engage with your product.

## Use body text to guide users out of the empty state

Explaining the reason for an empty state is crucial, but also guiding users out of the state is equally as important. When seeing a blank page, users feel lost and frustrated, and you should shortly explain to them what they can do next.

Also, you can use an empty state as an opportunity to explain what this page is for and how they can use it. If users don't understand functionality, they will bail.

## Provide descriptive error messages

![[Attachments/19489c8fb5775a9ba90e3f0db1e1811c_MD5.jpg]]

It may sound harsh, but most users don't care about your product's problems. What they want to know is whether you're fixing an issue and what they can do in the meantime. Good error messages don't blame users and use human language that speaks to their needs.

If possible, show them a workaround, provide an alternative action, or, at the very least, ensure that you'll resolve the problem soon. Make sure the message is explicit but concise, and the CTA button is noticeable on a page. Otherwise, users would feel lost and frustrated about their next step.

## Avoid too much clutter on the dashboard

For users that are new to a product, the [dashboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dashboard) is probably as sparse as it gets. In the case of an empty dashboard, images may do more harm than good. They run the risk of distracting users and keeping them from accomplishing their first goal. Try just some simple text and a primary button explaining what to do next.

## Multiple empty states

Seeing multiple empty states on a page at the same time can be overwhelming and confusing. Guide users through this unpleasant scenario by prioritizing actions into the primary, secondary, and tertiary ones. Don't put multiple actions on the same level, or users will get lost.

## Keep users from leaving

![[Attachments/c46c080295280e06b248cc95c902d80d_MD5.jpg]]

When users face an empty state, they perceive it as a moment of failure. Don't let them get discouraged and feel like it's their fault. In plain language explain what happened and what users can do.

**The No Results page should never be empty:**

-   Offer users to check the spelling
-   Provide possible [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) tips
-   Provide popular category or item recommendations.
-   Provide the recent search requests that users might want to get back to

Ultimately, a No Results page isn't necessarily a dead end. But you should always provide users with alternative paths so they won't feel lost or decide to leave.

## Handle 404 pages gracefully

![[Attachments/926336c532f8c206b3dadadccdf6858d_MD5.jpg]]

Pages get deleted, websites get reconstructed, or URLs get misspelled. Everybody has undoubtedly seen a 404-page page at least once. As you know, it implies the page doesn't exist, and usually, users have nothing else to do but go back to the previous page.

However, you can turn this into a delightful and memorable user experience. Try providing an engaging illustration and an easy way to go back. For example, you may offer users a bunch of links to explore some popular content and encourage them to stay instead of leaving. Of course, a dash of humor to lighten the mood is also welcome if the message fits the brand identity.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Monitor the traffic to your 404 page to ensure it's still the least visited page. Otherwise, you may need to explore the problem deeper.
