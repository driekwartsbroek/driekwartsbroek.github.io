# Chats & Messaging Basics and Best Practices
## Build in a typing indicator

A typing indicator is a [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) element that appears when other users are actively typing replies. Adding such an indicator to your chat helps prevent rapid and conflicting responses between people. 

Typing indicators can take different [forms](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms): from the little text that says "User is typing" to speech bubbles that animate in and out of view.

## Add timestamps

Timestamps show either the exact time when the message was sent (absolute timestamps) or how long ago it happened (relative timestamps).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> Indicating when the message was sent is vital — what was important an hour ago can become irrelevant in a couple of days.

**Tip!** When using absolute timestamps, make sure to convert them to users' time zones.

## Stack messages

Stacking messages that were sent over a short period of time keeps the UI cleaner. Nowadays, many users follow the internet rule "one thought, one message." When multiple messages are sent consecutively, you don't need to specify when each message was sent. Combine messages that were sent within a few seconds from one another under one common timestamp.

## Round the chat container corners

When designing chat [containers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container), go for rounded corners. Chat bubbles look visually clean and are pleasing to the eye. According to FMC (Fundamental Modeling Concepts) Guidelines, rounded lines are more natural for our eyes to follow.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> As corners point inward to the center, it helps users focus better on the container's [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content).

**Tip!** From childhood, we know that sharp corners can hurt while round corners are safe. The rounder, the better.

## Indicate the sender

Like comic book or cartoon speech bubbles, chat bubbles indicate the sender of the message. Different bubble [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) and little tails help users scan chats more efficiently and instantly identify the sender's and recipient's messages.

## Group messages by date

Use [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) with dates to group messages by date. Doing so simplifies scanning and prevents disorientation. Instead of reading through a chat with hundreds of messages, users can just scroll to the date they need.

## Avoid stretching chat containers' width

According to [Material Design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/material-design) guidelines, the ideal line length for English [body text](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/body-text) is 40 to 60 characters per line (including spaces).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Messengers with bubbles that take up the full width of the container feel a bit off and are harder for the eyes to follow. A smaller width, on the other hand, helps read messages quicker and generally looks more pleasing.

## Add a message preview

Sometimes, people don't want to read a message right away. Some messages are just annoying spam that you wholeheartedly ignore. That's why it's a good idea to show a message preview under the sender's name. It lets users know whether the message needs to be open asap or it can wait. 

## Make the notification badge prominent

Use a prominent [notification](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications) [badge](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/badges) to mark unread messages. People's memory isn't generally very reliable. Without the Unread badge, most people won't remember if they read a particular message or not — especially if they did that in the middle of a busy day.

## Be consistent

Differentiating messages sent by different users is fine, but too many colors make any interface feel cluttered. **To clearly distinguish who wrote what in a [dialog](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs), two colors are usually enough**. When it's a group chat, consider coloring their name rather than the whole bubble.

## Style system messages differently

When designing a messenger, make sure that system messages, such as "user joined the chat," look different from real users' messages to avoid confusion. Keep them subtle and use colors and [fonts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts) that go along with other [design elements](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-elements).
