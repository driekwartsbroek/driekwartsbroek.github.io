# Ensuring Mobile Accessibility Lesson  Uxcel
## Why mobile accessibility is important

First, let's take a look at some numbers. 15% of the worldwide population (~1 billion people) experience some [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) of disability (visual, cognitive, auditory, motor, etc.). And the disability numbers grow as the population ages.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

At the same time, the number of mobile users and the amount of web traffic coming from mobile devices increases annually by 1.8% (around 95 million people). According to the latest data from GSMA Intelligence, there are 5.31 billion unique mobile phone users worldwide, which is equivalent to 67.1% of the population. Plus, around 92% of all web traffic comes from mobile devices.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Thus, if you want your application or mobile website version to succeed, you should take care of mobile accessibility so all people who are interested in your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) can access it.

**Mobile interfaces have unique accessibility issues that are different from desktops such as:**

-   Touchscreens
-   Small screen sizes
-   Different [input](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) modalities
-   Usage in different environments such as bright sunlight or unstable internet connection

**Tip!** Explore our [Design Accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/design-accessibility) course to get familiar with different disabilities and the best design practices addressing accessibility issues.

## More than just phones and tablets

**Mobile accessibility ensures users with disabilities can consume [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) on not just phones and [tablets](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tablets) but also:**

-   Smart TVs
-   Car [dashboards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dashboard)
-   [Smartwatches](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/smartwatch) and other [wearables](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wearables)
-   Seatback screens in taxis and airplanes
-   Household appliances and other smart home technologies

Unfortunately, mobile apps don’t yet have a comprehensive accessibility guidebook like [the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for web and desktop interfaces. Mobile [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) should focus on general recommendations as well as on critical elements relevant only for mobile devices like [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) target size, screen sizes, device gestures, and data entry.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Types of impairments to design for

![[Attachments/9c931447af46c45449e77487b03708d6_MD5.jpg]]

By learning what challenges people with disabilities experience when interacting with interfaces, designers can develop [best practices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/best-practices) and achieve their accessibility goals. Generally, we may split the majority of impairments into 4 categories:

-   **Visual impairments:** Visually impaired individuals have difficulty interpreting interface elements. Mild forms of visual impairment can include things like the need for reading glasses to see up close. More severe forms include things like total blindness. [Color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) blind people may not be able to clearly discern certain colors, so you shouldn’t rely on color alone to indicate [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) or active [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states).
-   **Auditory impairments:** Auditory impairments are characterized by a partial or complete loss of hearing ability. Older people may have mild age-induced hearing problems, while some people may experience total hearing loss or deafness. When interacting with interfaces, users may struggle to listen to audio or video content. Adding transcripts and captions can be a solution.
-   **Mobility impairments:** Mobility impairments affect gross motor skills (like walking) or fine motor movement. Users experience difficulties manipulating objects by hand and may need special equipment or alternative methods to access the content. A temporary mobile impairment like a broken arm impacts users' abilities to type on a mobile [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards) or perform other tasks with their phone. A permanent mobile impairment like paralysis after trauma requires users to use assisting devices to access mobile devices.
-   **Neurological and cognitive impairments:** Neurological and cognitive impairments may be inherited or caused by brain or nerve injuries, infections, lifestyle, or environmental health problems. Epilepsy, learning disabilities, neuromuscular disorders, [autism](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/autism), ADD, brain tumors, cerebral palsy, etc., can affect one’s ability to learn, remember, or concentrate. They can also interfere with vision, hearing, and movement abilities. For example, employing large blocks of small text without enough [spacing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) or using a [typeface](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typeface) with low [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility) can affect users with dyslexia as well as visually-impaired people.

## Importance of WCAG standards

WCAG standards regulate accessibility for web [pages](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) and web applications. But what about mobile? Mobile devices are so different from desktop/laptop systems that they definitely require a unique approach to meeting accessibility regulations. In reality, the gap between them isn't that large. For example, many desktop/laptop devices have a touchscreen, while many mobile devices can be operated with an external keyboard and mouse.

Furthermore, most [UI components](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-components) and [design patterns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-patterns) are used in both desktop/laptop and mobile systems. That's why you can and should rely on WCAG 2.1 recommendations to maintain accessibility on both web and non-web interfaces.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

WCAG's recommendations may appear too overwhelming at first. However, WCAG's 4 principles can help designers keep things a bit more systemized.

-   **Perceivable:** Users should be able to access and process your content properly. Ideally, your system should address various disabilities and work with different types of assistive technology devices.
-   **Operable:** "Operable" means people should be able to access key [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) and functions through more than one method. For example, you should provide enough touch target sizes for interactive elements, consider alternative input entries, and ensure users have other ways to access features that are generally approached through gestures.
-   **Understandable:** Users must be able to not just access but also understand the content. Clear [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), concise sentences, and adequate instructions help clarify to users what they should do to complete a task.
-   **Robust:** Systems should support various operating systems, browsers, and assistive technologies that their target audience may use. Following development standards and conventions ensures your code is supported across platforms without obstacles.

## Design for varying screen sizes

Smaller screen size is one of the main challenges of [mobile design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile-design). One of the first decisions you should make is to decide on the [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) approach — responsive or adaptive. Or you may want to go with a native app. Regardless of the design approach, you'll need to optimize information for a mobile viewport and declutter the interface to maintain scannability and clarity.

What other practices can help designers maintain accessibility even on a small screen?

-   **Information [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy):** If you have an existing website or a desktop application, you cannot simply cut off half of the content to optimize it for a mobile app. Instead, you need to tailor content to mobile usage scenarios. Include fewer content modules and fewer [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) and prioritize things, placing the most popular features on top where users see them first.
-   **Use mobile UI components with caution:** At first sight, using [tabs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tabs), [modals](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals), [cards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards), [dropdowns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown), [accordions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accordions), and other similar elements can seem to be a great help as they reveal additional content on request and take up less space. However, they may be challenging for users with impairments. To enhance accessibility, enlarge the [font size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/font-size) and provide a large enough touch target zone to minimize the needs of users with low vision to zoom in on content.
-   **Avoid placing elements in a [row](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/rows):** Elements placed in a row are harder to scan. You also don't have as much horizontal space on a mobile device. Place form fields or [selection controls](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/selection-controls) (like [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes) and [radio buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/radio-buttons)) below each other.

## Touch target size and placement

![[Attachments/373bfc5ebd8eaa2cbf41430e4d9dbbb6_MD5.jpg]]

Mobile pages may contain multiple interactive elements, e.g., primary and secondary buttons, [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus), [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons), and [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links). These elements must be large enough and have enough distance between each other so that users can easily reach them.

WCAG recommends the minimum size of the touch target zone to be at least 9x9mm, which is equivalent to 34px.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup> Furthermore, [Material Design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/material-design) guidelines recommend a touch target size of at least 48x48px, while [iOS](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ios) guidelines specify a slightly smaller minimum of 44x44px.

However, if you're designing an app that will be used when users are on the go, controls should have even larger targets to allow more room for error.

Additionally, provide enough spacing between interactive elements (at least 8dp/16px) and add a small amount of inactive space around elements with touch targets close to the minimum.

The placement of interactive elements can also be a dealbreaker. It's essential to place primary buttons within thumb's reach as users often operate mobile devices with one hand.

**Tip!** Larger touchscreens require larger targets to be noticeable which reduces the time to reach them. Smaller touchscreens like smartwatches should use gestures or voice control as alternative means of interaction.

## Keep gestures simple

People associate mobile interfaces with touchscreen gestures that can be simple (like tap or swipe) or more complicated, involving multiple fingers or taps.

To comply with the accessibility requirements, designers should try to utilize the easiest gestures and avoid or replace complex ones that are too challenging for users with visual, motor, or dexterity impairments.

Developers should also help users with disabilities prevent unintentional or accidental taps.

The system should activate an element only when the first and last position of the finger is inside of this interactive element. When a user’s finger moves away after the first touch, the element should not be activated.

Another common mistake is the lack of visual indicators of touchscreen gestures. For example, the swipe from the edge of the screen that activates a menu is not easy to discover. As a solution, we can inform users about gestures and features through labels and helper text.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Some mobile apps involve device manipulation gestures like shaking or tilting. Make sure to provide alternative touch and keyboard control options that simulate device motions.

## Strive for consistency

![[Attachments/033efca17fdb303331dc92fdd6b92d0b_MD5.jpg]]

Consistency and standards constitute the fourth of Jakob Nielsen's ten [heuristics](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/heuristics).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup> A good system should use the same patterns everywhere and follow platform- and domain-specific conventions.

Consistency is not about limiting designers' creativity and making all products look alike. Instead, applications that follow standards are more predictable to users, are easier to learn, and cause less [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload).

Placing a [logo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/logos) in the same top-left corner on each page, using a house icon for a home page, locating secondary destinations like [Settings](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/settings) inside a sidebar menu, and using the same color for active elements (buttons or links) — these familiar patterns help users navigate, feel more comfortable, get used to a new app faster, and reduce confusion.

## Easy methods for data entry

![[Attachments/72f0d7173de14d4a2503d0b0c6b873a3_MD5.jpg]]

Data entry can be time-consuming and challenging for all types of audiences, especially those with motor, visual, or cognitive disabilities.

**Try to minimize the need for entry by:**

-   Providing smart defaults based on the most common answers
-   Offering the user's last entries and the most popular answers and selections
-   Autofilling the data based on users' location (like time, country, city, etc.) and previously saved information ([email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email), phone number, credit card number, etc.)
-   Replacing inputs with selection controls like checkboxes, radio buttons, [toggle](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/toggles) [switches](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches), or menus

Consider adding other ways of data entry alternative to onscreen typing, like voice input.

## Multiple ways to perceive content

![[Attachments/e7c74662e0bc0f0dfb0d562983ce2afc_MD5.jpg]]

One of the accessibility principles requires a system to be perceivable. It implies that all users should be able to access content as easily as possible. **Implementing these guidelines can help make your design perceivable:**

-   Set the default text size and allow users to adjust it using on-page controls for text [resizing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/resizing). The minimum recommended size for [body text](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/body-text) is 16px.
-   Allow users to use pinch-zoom to magnify the entire screen.
-   Use short, simple sentences (5-8 words) and break long text into digestible chunks using [white space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space).
-   Use accurate alternative text. Users with visual impairments can't access images, videos, GIFs, and [illustrations](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/illustration) without screen readers. Make sure to accompany imagery with alt text — informative descriptions that convey the meaning of an image.
-   Provide captions and transcripts of video content to allow people with hearing impairments to read content they can't hear.

**Tip!** Utilize legible typefaces that offer clear distinctions between similar letterforms and remain easy to read, even at smaller sizes, like Source Sans Pro, Public Sans, Merriweather, or Roboto Mono. For additional accessibility tips, be sure to explore the [Design Accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/design-accessibility) course.

## Color contrast for accessibility

![[Attachments/9aeb0ce4f7c8b955c094619d7524aaee_MD5.jpg]]

Color is a powerful tool for delivering information and impacting users' emotions. Designers rely on color to inform users about errors, indicate active and disabled states, show interactivity, group related objects, or make an element stand out.

That's why it is so crucial to maintain a sufficient color [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) ratio. It's especially relevant for mobile devices that people often use outside under extreme sunlight where they may not be able to see interface elements well.

WCAG’s standards require a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal-sized text (smaller than 24px or 18.5px if bold) and at least 3:1 for larger text (larger than 24px or 18.5px if bold).

[Web Aim Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) is one of the most popular [tools](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) for checking the contrast ratio between your [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) and text.
