[Badges](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/badges) tell users that something is waiting for them inside the app — it could be a new message, a reaction, a reminder, etc. Most of the time, badges are located at the top right of [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons). Stick to this badge [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment), as users are used to it.

Use badges rationally — although they can increase engagement, users will start ignoring them if they become annoying.

## Use dashed badge borders

John Lennon dreamed about a world without borders. Open borders are great for badges too! It may seem like a small thing but using white badge borders has its advantages, as it makes badges more visible and visually appealing.

## Stick to the dot shape

Sometimes, it's better to stick to popular solutions rather than experimenting with awesome but untested ideas. People are used to round, dot-shaped badges. Why change their [shape](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes) and add more cognitive friction for users?

## Use colors meaningfully

Hollywood movies taught us that good always triumphs over evil. Olympic winners showed us that the impossible is possible. In turn, the internet trained us to perceive green as online. Colors have meaning in the design world. Green generally means available, yellow means away, and red means unavailable or busy.

## Use conventional status indicators

No matter where we are in the world, traffic light colors mean the same in every country. Similarly, when we open a new app — especially a messenger — we understand what [status](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/status) indicator colors and icons tell us. For instance, green means that our contact is available, red indicates that they are busy, and so on. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

The icons that go with the colors have also become universal — the check mark, the clock face, and the stop sign. Follow widely-used practices, and users will get familiar with your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) quicker. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Only use badge count to display the number of unread notifications

![[Attachments/97257b1d3f387a75f6952a822f897e46_MD5.jpg]]

A notification badge count should only be used to display the number of unread notifications on the app such as unread direct or group messages, [emails](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email), promotions, reminders, confirmations, cancellations, etc. This does not include numerical information unrelated to notifications such as game scores, weather updates, or stock [prices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/price).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Place alerts strategically

![[Attachments/4fb06949f980b688d02483befa78db7c_MD5.jpg]]

Usually, [alert](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts) notifications require immediate [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions), which should be evident to users. But this doesn't mean they should be obtrusive — make them stand out while letting users finish what they're doing through strategic placement.

## Place toasts in the bottom of the screen

![[Attachments/33fda82f730fdd07eabe075521047073_MD5.jpg]]

[Toasts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/toasts) contain feedback about users' actions in a small popup. They should be informative without stealing the show, so the best placement for them is the bottom of the screen.

## Keep toasts away from FABs

It's important to keep toasts away from other elements, including [floating action buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fabs) — FABs. Toasts should inform users about the results of their actions, not distract them from [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation).

## Stack notifications visibly

When stacking notifications, ensure they are all fully visible and don't overshadow navigation elements.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> Also, ensure that they are stacked in a way that their entire contents are visible without being cut off from the screen or being overlapped by other elements.
