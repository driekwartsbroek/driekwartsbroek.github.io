Tags come in handy when there's a lot of diverse [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) that can be overwhelming to process. Basic tags inform users what category the element is part of.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Action tag

Also called assist or suggestion [chips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chips), action tags are a different ballgame — they are more similar to [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) as pressing them triggers an action, usually redirecting users to another [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) or widget. In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to buttons, they're more compact, and you can easily place a few of them in a [row](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/rows).

## Choice tag

We use choice tags to provide multiple options when users need to make a selection.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> For example, when filling out a [user profile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/profile), you might see choice tags offering several gender options. After making a choice, users stay on the same page and can continue their journey.

## Input tag

You know when you start typing an [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) of contact in Gmail, their complete info appears? Then when you select it, it wraps into a cleanly formatted name. We call this an input tag. Its job is to make using [inputs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) easier by offering suggestions and verifying known entities.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Detail tag

Detail tags are any tags that offer extra information, such as counters that update the number of listed items in the category. This function can be used in other types of tags — for example, filter tags can also include the number of items listed in each category.

## Filter tag

Filter tags help sort content by categories**.**[<sup>[1]&nbsp;</sup>](https://material.io/components/chips#input-chips) Let's say you follow 1000+ YouTube channels, and your home page has thousands of recommendations of movie reviews, funny cat videos, [UX design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-design) tutorials, and electronic music. Pressing the "[design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design)" tag will leave you with educational design videos, cutting off unrelated content.

## Dismissible tag

Filter tags or input tags can be dismissible tags — users can deselect them by clicking "x." For example, if you applied too many filters to your [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) and nothing came up, you can dismiss one or more of the filters — it's doubtful that you might find a brand-new iPhone for under $50, so one of these filters would have to go.
