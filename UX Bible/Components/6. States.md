# 6. States
## Enabled state

![[Attachments/86112ab59f061d140471523496e9c680_MD5.jpg]]

The two most basic states for [UI components](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-components) are enabled and disabled. Enabled states signal to users that an element is ready to be interacted with. Use [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) or [shadow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shadows) to make the element stand out within the interface and to convey that it’s interactive.

Following the [Material Design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/material-design) guidelines, [selection controls](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/selection-controls) appear the same in both enabled and selected states.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Disabled state

Elements in disabled states are not ready to be interacted with. Think of them as a “Sorry, we’re closed” sign on a business.

One of the most common uses of a disabled state is with a Submit [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) on a [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) that stays disabled until required form [fields](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) have been filled out. It seems logical to gray out disabled elements but consider reducing their overall opacity instead.

## Hover state

When an element is hovered over by a user’s [cursor](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cursors), it should change to its hover state. It gives users a visual cue that they can take some kind of action with the element.

Hover state is a micro-interaction that helps give users a well-rounded experience. Including both “hover on” and “hover off” [animations](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/animation) can provide further positive interaction for users.

## Pressed state

Along with the hover state, the pressed state also helps create a well-rounded element. Because the pressed state usually only appears briefly — when a button or other element is currently being tapped or clicked — its importance is often overlooked. But it's an important indication for users that the system will respond as soon as the element is released.

## Focused state

The focused state is vital for [accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accessibility). While some users will never see the focused state, those that use their voice or the [Tab](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tabs) ↹ key to navigate an interface benefit from a visual cue that tells them which element is currently in focus.

Focused states are often shown with either a border around the element, an overlay, or a change to the element’s fill color.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> Be careful not to use a focused state that is styled too closely to other element states, so as not to confuse users.

## Selected state

The selected state indicates a user’s choice and is most commonly seen around elements like [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes) or [radio buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/radio-buttons). This state appears regardless of how a user made their choice, whether it was by tapping, clicking, using their voice, or with their [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards). 

Selected states should be made clear but not too prominently. Otherwise, they can distract users from surrounding elements. A simple border or color change could be well enough.

Elements such as radio buttons or checkboxes should follow standard UI patterns to show they're selected (filled with a dot or checkmark, respectively).

## Activated state

Activated states indicate what a user is viewing, such as [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) result [filters](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters) or the current tab in an interface. They're usually highlighted with overlays or color changes.

Activated states give users an immediate reference point to orient themselves within a website or app. Ensure they're easy to spot within the interface without overpowering other [design elements](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-elements).

## Dragged state

![[Attachments/faf5e6528ff3da334853b3d6fb4702b4_MD5.jpg]]

When an interface includes draggable elements (such as being able to reorder a playlist), it’s essential to create a dragged state.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> When an element is held and moved from one place to another, it enters this state.

One of the most effective ways to indicate a dragged state is with a smooth shadow that indicates elevation as if the element was being lifted. Lowering the opacity of surrounding elements can also assist in this state. Be sure to include some visual cue for where the dragged element will be placed when it is released.

**Tip!** Give users a clear visual cue for where the dragged element will be placed to avoid confusion and frustration.

## On state

Like physical [switches](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches), interface switches can have both on and off states. The on state is immediate, taking effect right away. Color and overall appearance should change, clearly indicating whether the switch is on or off.

Note that on states (and off states) are sometimes used on UI elements other than switches, such as a button that turns a microphone or camera off in an app like Zoom. The same guidelines for clearly indicating the on state still apply.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Off state

In the off state, the change should be immediate and the opposite of whatever the on state is. Think of how a switch can activate or turn off [dark mode](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dark-mode) for example. Regardless of what the switch does, it should be clear and explicit which direction is _on_ and which direction is _off_.

## Error state

![[Attachments/04c46e6ced8a7639af634927d5b362d6_MD5.jpg]]

[Error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) states are activated when a user makes a mistake or something in the interface fails to work. These are particularly useful in forms when a user either enters invalid data or misses a required field. Error messages associated with error states should be polite and unobtrusive, but also clearly state the problem. Using a [shade](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shades) of red (not too bright) or some other [contrasting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) colors and soft shadows around the problem area works perfectly.

If possible, include inline error messages in real-time rather than error messages only triggered when the user submits a form. It’s less frustrating for the user and saves them time and effort.
