# 13. Modals Intro
## Modals vs non-modals

![[Attachments/1eca5d712d170487e21e6ebc09acdb9b_MD5.jpg]]

When modal dialogs pop up, they require user [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) before users can continue using the rest of the application. In other words, they block interaction with the rest of the application until the dialog is dismissed.

Non-modal dialogs (also called modeless), on the other hand, do not block interaction with the rest of the application. They can easily be ignored or minimized by users and do not cause any disruption to their tasks.

## When to use modals

![[Attachments/92bbf69d79d25c9f30476ba6f0f416e1_MD5.jpg]]

Modal dialogues demand immediate user [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) and disrupt their flow, meaning that they should not be used often and without due cause.

Here are some situations where it is acceptable to use a modal:

-   **Confirming an action:** If users are about to perform an irreversible action, such as deleting data or closing a document without saving changes, a modal dialogue can be used to ask for confirmation before proceeding.
-   **Displaying critical information:** If there is important information that users need to know, a modal dialogue can be used to display it. For example, letting users know that a crucial software update is pending.
-   **Getting [input](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs):** If users need to provide input before proceeding with a task, a modal dialogue can be used to get the input. For example, requesting [login](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/login) information when users attempt to add items to their wishlist. Modals can also be used to collect pertinent information from users that will make the [UX](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) better and more personalized for them in the long run.
-   **Simplifying workflows:** Modal dialogs can be used to break up complex information into simpler, more digestible chunks during a multi-step process. For instance, when users are [setting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/settings) up a new account on a website, a wizard can be used to guide them through the process step-by-step. Each step can be presented in a separate modal dialog, which prompts users for specific information related to that step.

## Popup modal

![[Attachments/828cc23e73534ef464d6e6dec372043b_MD5.jpg]]

Popup modal dialogs are the most common type of modal. They tend to appear as a window over a portion of the [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages), often using a [contrasting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) or [animation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/animation) that attracts [user attention](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-attention). The [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) they appear against is usually darkened or blurred, disabling the main [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). Most importantly, they force users to either take action within the popup or close it to continue engaging with the main content again.

These modal dialogs can appear in response to user-initiated actions, such as clicking a [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) or [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links), or they can be triggered automatically by the system in response to a specific event, such as an [error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) or [warning](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/warning).

## Fullscreen desktop modal

![[Attachments/c21ebf5b4b95d61d760c587be57afc41_MD5.jpg]]

Fullscreen desktop modal dialogs are similar to popup modals in that they block the main content until dismissed by users one way or the other. As the name suggests, they take up the entire screen and are typically used to display important or time-sensitive information that requires the immediate attention of users. This means they can look like a new page altogether.

These modals are commonly used for tasks such as logging in or registering for an account, displaying terms and conditions, or providing feedback or error messages. They can also be used for more complex interactions, such as making a payment or completing a multi-step [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms).

Because fullscreen desktop modals take up the entire screen, they can be particularly effective in capturing user attention and preventing distractions. However, they can also be intrusive if overused, and may interrupt the [user flow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow) if not implemented carefully.

## Fullscreen mobile modal

Fullscreen [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) modals are similar to full-screen desktop modals in that they are a type of [user interface component](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-components) that appears as a pop-up window over the existing content of a mobile website or application. However, they are specifically designed for use on mobile [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device), which have smaller screens than desktop devices.

Like their desktop counterparts, fullscreen mobile modals are typically used to display important or time-sensitive information that requires the immediate attention of users.

**Tip!** It is important to ensure that fullscreen mobile modals are designed to be easily dismissible, as users may become frustrated if they cannot easily close the modal and return to the main content of the site or app.

## Popover modal

![[Attachments/e755fc19c2aadbb9319d8010fda88b15_MD5.jpg]]

Popovers are small windows that appear as an overlay when users click or tap an interactive area of a website or application. Popovers are typically used to provide contextual information or options that relate to the content or task at hand.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

Popovers are different from popup modals because they don't block or prevent interaction with the main content. Instead, they appear alongside it. Unlike fullscreen modals, popovers also do not take up the entire screen but instead appear as a small, floating window that can be easily dismissed or closed. They are often triggered by user actions such as hovering over an element, clicking a button or link, or performing a specific [gesture](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/gestures) on a [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) screen.

Popovers are commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as displaying additional information about a [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product), providing options for customization, or presenting a [call-to-action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) for a particular task. They can be particularly effective in situations where users need additional information or guidance but do not want to be taken away from the main content of the site or app.

**Tip!** Avoid using popovers to display vital information since they can be easily overlooked.

## Lightbox modal

![[Attachments/948697639d727a52337eadc50a26e350_MD5.jpg]]

A [lightbox](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lightbox) modal opens [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) or videos into a larger format that overlays the entire screen. They are triggered by user actions such as clicking on an image or a button and typically include [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) such as [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) controls, captions, and the ability to zoom in or out.

One of the key benefits of using a lightbox modal is that it allows users to focus on the media or content being displayed without navigating away from the main page. This can be particularly useful in situations where users want to view an image or video in more detail but do not want to lose their place on the website or application.

Common [use cases](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/use-case) for lightboxes are [photo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos) and video-centered [designs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) since these modals create a projector-like experience when viewing multimedia content.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** If more than one image or video can appear in the same lightbox, provide users with visual cues to indicate that.

## Modal position

![[Attachments/ecde36635d1af0a25332338583361bd8_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/3a4416c6ae22a7c23e4ef434830f5dd4_MD5.jpg]]

As a rule of thumb, the best position for modals that are not fullscreen is centered. On mobile, center modals vertically and horizontally to make them stand out. On desktop devices, center the modal horizontally, but consider placing it a bit closer to the top of the screen. This will ensure the modal doesn't change its position if the window is resized.

**Tip!** This rule does not apply to popovers — they are better off being displayed close to the interactive elements that trigger them.

## Simple modal

![[Attachments/d819371f42790026bbc4f8c24c488a46_MD5.jpg]]

Simple modals display a [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of items that take immediate effect when selected and don't contain CTA buttons or other interactive elements**.** To close the modal, users need to either choose one of the options or dismiss the modal by clicking or tapping outside. 

Simple modals can be intrusive as they disrupt users' workflow. Consider if other options such as [dropdowns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown) are suitable for the task.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> 

## Alert modal

![[Attachments/9c7153da419f5010b4c8afa03dbfdb6f_MD5.jpg]]

[Alert](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts) modals interrupt users with urgent information, details, or actions. To close it, users need to either select one of the actions or, if the modal allows it, dismiss it.

Alert modals can be useful for important information like error messages — for example, when a file fails to upload. A modal ensures that users see the message, whereas inline messages may go unnoticed.

**Tip!** When choosing alert modal CTAs, avoid generic words like "yes," "no," or "cancel." Instead, use verbs that make it clear what each button does.

## Confirmation modal

![[Attachments/caa36cf1574216f260095a5274e8ffa1_MD5.jpg]]

Confirmation modals require users to confirm a choice before the dialog is dismissed. These modals always contain buttons to confirm and dismiss the action. 

Use confirmation modals before destructive and irreversible actions, not routine actions. For example, it makes sense to confirm if users want to delete their accounts permanently. On the other hand, changing non-essential settings like [dark mode](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dark-mode) doesn't require confirmation.

**Tip!** Use this type of modal sparingly so that users don't get tired of them and start closing them without even reading them.

## Android dialogs

![[Attachments/23cb3d70952c4a4b71644fea04383426_MD5.jpg]]

On [Android](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/android), modals are called dialogs. A dialog consists of a title (that can sometimes be omitted), content, and buttons. The content can include text or other components like option lists or text fields. Dialogs use the Roboto [typeface](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typeface) and avoid solid [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) between buttons. Button [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) tend to be in all caps.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Android bottom sheets

![[Attachments/503ccec8e00722b8ad2e0459169134ec_MD5.jpg]]

Android also offers what's called a bottom sheet, which appears from the bottom of the screen. The Android bottom sheet slides up when the kebab [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) is tapped.

**Modal bottom sheets can have 2 types of content:**

-   A list of available actions
-   An app list that appears after users tap the Share icon

## iOS alerts

![[Attachments/1085b11e9d7cb3727ce0ffc77029d28a_MD5.jpg]]

On [iOS](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ios), modals are called alerts. An alert has a title, content (which can be omitted), and buttons. Alerts use the San Francisco typeface, and the primary action button is slightly bolder than the secondary buttons. Dividers are also used in between the content and the buttons.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## iOS action sheets

![[Attachments/4b21ae3bd427b84746e3b314466e4827_MD5.jpg]]

iOS has an action sheet modal similar to the Android bottom sheet with a list of actions. The difference is that this modal can be triggered by any button and not just the kebab menu. When activated, the action sheet slides in from the bottom.
