# 2. Menus Intro
## Basic dropdown menu

Basic menus are [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) controls that contain a simple [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of options from which users may only select one option at a time. Once users make a selection, the menu gets closed.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

If the menu is close to the edge of the screen, align it vertically to keep all menu items visible.

## Cascading menu

Cascading menus are an excellent choice for categorized [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). They include a parent element and its children. The children usually unfold when users select or hover over an option.

This type of menu is useful when some options contain multiple sub-options. For example, the item New often includes the types of new documents users can create. 

Avoid adding too many options to the children menus, however. This can make cascading menus cumbersome and overwhelming. If you need to use too many items, consider changing the [user flow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow) altogether.

**Tip!** Cascading menus should never be used on mobile.

## Contextual menu

![[Attachments/5673686545909c9c4308a20f04e22c8c_MD5.jpg]]

Contextual menus appear when users interact with a specific element. On desktops, they are usually triggered on right-click or with a [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards) [shortcut](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shortcuts).

Contextual menus appear next to where users click. Their list of options can vary based on the click target — for example, it can be different for text and [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images).

Usually, contextual menus contain frequently used [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) related to the current context. For example, right-clicking on text in Google Docs reveals a contextual menu with text-specific actions like Copy, Paste, Delete.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Contextual menus are hidden by default, and users may not know they exist. That's why it's important to also make these actions accessible from a visible place, like the menu bar.

## Single-select menu

![[Attachments/f15aa9b7a4f262ac0f0c2572616bb479_MD5.jpg]]

Single-select menus allow users to pick one option from a list. They come in handy when the menu options are mutually exclusive — only one option can be chosen at a time.

Single-select menus need to include a selection indicator to make the user's choice. Commonly it's a checkmark, bold text, or [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) overlay.

Single-select menus are great for selection, especially when [filtering](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters). However, avoid using this menu type to activate [modal](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals) windows, [dialog](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs) boxes, or dynamic controls.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Multiselect menu

![[Attachments/accb1ef3316032eb976573ab87bee26d_MD5.jpg]]

Multiselect menus allow users to choose more than one list item at a time.

**There are several ways to let users pick multiple options:**

-   Hold hotkeys like Shift, [Command](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/commands), or Control while clicking on items
-   Tick [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes)
-   Move items from the list of all the options to the list of selected options
-   Click on items from the list leading to the chosen items on top as [tags](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tags)

Make the chosen items highly visible to lessen the [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload). Multiselect menus aren't a great option on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) because they require a lot of space that mobile apps don't have.

**Tip!** Make sure users have a way to deselect all items if they change their minds.

## Search menu

![[Attachments/a89c515d581cf1b8c01f879d661c2d27_MD5.jpg]]

Use [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) menus for long lists — for example, for lists of countries or languages. Such menus automatically filter results as users type with auto-suggest or auto-complete functions. 

Adding search to a long menu instead of scroll allows users to find what they're looking for much easier.

## Inline menu

![[Attachments/7386fd70dd5ae7f75a10b02f310e870f_MD5.jpg]]

A dropdown menu can be formatted to appear inline in other content.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> Like other [dropdowns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown), inline menus unfurl on click. Think of them as [sorting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/sorting) menus, like in the example.

Inline menus should prominently hover above the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background), indicating that their content is more relevant at the given moment.

## Menu scrolling

The [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) of the screen limits the number of menu items we can show at once. One of the solutions is to add scrolling. Don't forget the [scroll bar](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/scroll-bar) as it indicates the user's relative position in the list.

If the number of options is too big, scrolling can become tedious. In this case, adding search to the menu can be an option — or changing the user flow altogether.

How many options are too many? We say a couple of scroll wheel turns, but use common sense to determine that.

## Menu labels

![[Attachments/40596ff6a7c4284a03f6eef87c22c4bf_MD5.jpg]]

Menu labels should tell what happens when users click or tap the item. They must be clear and concise. Long or confusing labels — for example, using jargon — will cause unnecessary cognitive load, which will slow users down.

To create user-friendly menu labels, use conventional labels such as Paste instead of Insert. The labels should be relevant to the menu and simple so that even non-native speakers can understand them. 

And most importantly, [test](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) your labels. What seems clear to you might confuse your users. [Research methods](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-methods) such as [card sorting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/card-sorting) can help you get feedback on your labels.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Verbs and verbal nouns are perfect for labels as they imply action.

## Menu states

![[Attachments/e1063ca5ebeca59c6e5439925b798623_MD5.jpg]]

As with any interactive element, menu options need to be responsive to users' actions. Menu states should change when users select an element or hover over it.

The most common way to indicate the change of state is to use color overlays with low opacity.

## Selection state icon

![[Attachments/350cd65ac2265829da46d9e1238d09dd_MD5.jpg]]

The selection state icon is the mark that indicates what item or items users have chosen in a single-select or multiselect menu.

Most commonly it's either a checkmark or an "X". These symbols feel intuitive to users as that's what we use when we fill out paper [forms](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms). Avoid using unconventional marks for selection state icons to not confuse users.

**Tip!** The selected option can also be indicated with color overlay.

## Leading icons

![[Attachments/35ef70f3ada25f06c3c61dcebf086e5a_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/7661320d1b0cb5baba03db6ca02ff26d_MD5.jpg]]

Leading icons are the visual cues that appear in menus. When scanning the menu, users recognize familiar icons much faster than they read labels. Common examples of leading icons are the scissor icon for "Cut" and the two sheets of paper for "Copy" commands.

Place leading icons before the label, or to the left in left-to-right writing systems, so users see them first. Make sure to choose commonly used icons with universal meaning — unfamiliar leading icons will only confuse users.

**Tip!** If you doubt whether icons are self-explanatory enough, test them on your users with open-ended questions like: "What do you think this icon means?"

## Divider

![[Attachments/c616ba996c70b2d9a91b20680f5aff32_MD5.jpg]]

If you need to group items within a single menu, consider using a divider. [Dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) are usually a pale horizontal line between sections of a menu.

Dividers help group related items together. At the same time, they visually separate different item groups without the need to create separate menus.

**Tip!** Color overlays and negative space can also play the divider's role.

## Keyboard shortcuts

![[Attachments/8ca954b06ec29d2e89b6028e6944ac0e_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/093dce93f2e057e257086d75624fb718_MD5.jpg]]

You can include keyboard shortcuts in the menu to help users learn them. Shortcuts trigger specific actions without the need to navigate to the menu itself. As users become familiar with them, it can really [speed](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/speed) up their workflow.

There's no need to create shortcuts for all possible actions and menu items. Add them for the most common actions like copying, cutting, and pasting. 

Keep in mind that only advanced users routinely use keyboard shortcuts, so make sure they're not the primary way — or the only one — to complete a task.
