The row height of your table should make it easy for users to read the information each row contains. There are three common [sizes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size): condensed (40px), regular (48px), and relaxed (56px).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

Condensed rows can help display data without scrolling, though it is harder to read than the other two row heights. If seeing the entire table at once is important to the table’s function, then condensed rows make sense. Otherwise, using regular or relaxed row heights provides a better [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience).

## Column width

After row height, your column width is another key factor in the table’s readability. Yes, each column’s width will be dependent on the width of its [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content), but readability still needs to be the top priority. Make sure there are wide enough [margins](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/margins) on both sides of a column so that users can effortlessly scan, compare, or edit the table.

## Header style

Table headers — the [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) that briefly describe each column’s content — are a necessary component of every table. The header style should set these labels apart from the rest of the text in the table through an established visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy), without becoming overwhelming or intrusive. This can be done by using a slightly darker [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) or bold text for table headers.

## Sorting

[Sorting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/sorting) functionality is one of the most important interactive [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) of any large table. Working with large data sets can be a nightmare without a sorting option.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Rows can be sorted in alphabetical or numerical order ascendingly or descendingly, allowing users to view the data in whatever way suits their needs best.

## Toolbar

[Toolbars](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/toolbars) can add a lot of functionality to your tables. They sit above the table and usually contain a variety of functions. You can include things like [searching](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search), exporting, printing, [filtering](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters), and sorting options in the toolbar, increasing the overall [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) and usefulness of the table’s data.

## Row hover state

When interacting with specific rows within a table, showing visual indicators of that interaction improves usability. Because of the uniform look of tables, it can be easy for users to lose their place. Adding a row hover [state](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) to your rows can save users frustration when trying to compare data across an entire row.

This state makes it easy for users to keep track of their position within the table, which is especially important when rows are actionable.

## Selected row

There are instances where users need to select rows within the table, such as when making bulk edits. The selected rows should be highlighted so they’re set apart visually. Simply including a checkmark at the side of the row doesn’t cut it as it can easily go unnoticed by users.

## Inline menu

When you want users to be able to interact within each row, including an inline [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) can give them a broad range of possible [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions).

Hiding these actions behind a kebab (three-dot) menu saves [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing), reduces visual clutter, and makes it easier for the table data to be scanned without interference from [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) or other action items.

Just be aware that users likely won’t be aware of the options in the inline menu until they actually start interacting with the table.

## Pagination

![[Attachments/3fcd1de88cb7adedeeedd5740b52756c_MD5.jpg]]

[Pagination](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pagination) is the simplest way to break up your table into more usable chunks. To reduce server load and make it easy for users to flip through the content, split the table into pages with a set number of rows on each page. Be sure to make it clear which page the user is currently on.

**Tip!** To prevent confusion, display the number of rows your users are viewing on the current page out of the total count.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Infinite scrolling

As an alternative to pagination, infinite scrolling keeps [loading](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/loading) more data as the user scrolls down. Users can load more data without having to hit the Next button or flip through multiple pages.

The downside to infinite scrolling is that it doesn’t keep track of pages, so referring back to data users have already passed can be difficult. It also doesn’t give users an idea of how much data exists in the table, which can be frustrating.

## Manual infinite scrolling

Manual infinite scrolling combines the ideas of pagination and infinite scrolling. When users get to the bottom of the data that has already been loaded, they’re specifically asked if they want to load more.

With manual infinite scrolling, content is shown in easy-to-consume chunks as users scroll down the page, but gives them control over the experience. The advantage over pagination is that previous rows remain visible, but as with infinite scroll, it doesn’t automatically tell users how much data is left to load.

**Tip!** Make sure that the Load More button is clearly visible to engage users to continue exploring the data.
