By differentiating the table [header](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/header) from the body and giving it more emphasis, you establish information hierarchy in your [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design). Use a more prominent [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background), [font](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts) weight, and color to emphasize the [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) and make it easier for users to scan the table.

## Indicate overflow content

The contents of a table don't always fit in fixed-sized cells, so overflows are inevitable. **When [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) overflows in tables, you can choose to:**

-   Indicate that the text has been truncated using ellipses
-   Provide [tooltips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) containing the full text when the mouse hovers the cell
-   Provide an option for users to adjust the size of [columns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/columns) and [rows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/rows)
-   Allow users to hide and reorder columns to only display the information that is relevant to them<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Align numbers to the right

The type of alignment used in tables depends on the type of data. With numbers, right alignment is much better because users can compare numeric values regardless of their size.

## Align text to the left

![[Attachments/94c7ceeae9c3ae684ce95ef012371530_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/4fd11e51c6d0bc11e3667419c9bcca0b_MD5.jpg]]

In left-to-right languages, such as English, the natural reading pattern is from left to right. When table text is not aligned to the left, users may find it difficult and frustrating to scan the content.

By aligning the text to the left, the content becomes more scannable and easier to read, allowing users to quickly locate the information they need. This is particularly important when dealing with large tables or complex datasets, as it can help users quickly understand the relationships between different elements and identify patterns or trends.

Finally, left-aligned text is also more aesthetically pleasing and can improve the overall look and feel of the table. By creating a consistent visual [style](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style), left-aligned text can help make the table more visually appealing and engaging for users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Align headers the same way as the content in their respective columns.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Use a legible typeface

![[Attachments/6eb8ffbbe3afcb4968ef5dcf5d3acb45_MD5.jpg]]

When designing a table, a distinct and legible [typeface](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typeface) is a must. Sans serif fonts meet all criteria for this purpose as they're less decorative and more readable than serifs. Besides, sans serif simplicity helps reduce the [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and better understand the content.

**Tip!** Take a closer look at Roboto, Verdana, or Helvetica when deciding on a typeface for table loaded content.

## Provide resizable columns

![[Attachments/f931663d5fd998e5d1bf1303e8b3d5ec_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/e53f22469703ec72586ca14d4fff7c30_MD5.jpg]]

Resizable columns can be a great help when the content doesn't fit the cell. They allow users to view whole pieces of information that are relevant to them without having to go back and forth.

To let your users know that the columns on the table can be resized, use the [cursor](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cursors) that indicates that the columns can be resized and you're all set.

## Allow sorting

![[Attachments/144843f8e315d6bff758efeb1efced86_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/a4589772d4ac7affc107088e6af42071_MD5.jpg]]

Allow users to sort the content by different categories in an ascending or descending order — for example, alphabetically or chronologically. Overloaded tables are hard to scan, making it difficult to compare data — and [sorting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/sorting) can make it easier.

You can indicate that sorting is available for a column using an upward or downward arrow [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons). If adding the icon to all columns adds too much visual noise to your design, consider displaying it only over hover. Also, keep the sort icon visible when it is active for a column.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Include a sticky table header

Obscuring the label when users start scrolling makes long tables impossible to read and analyze. Add a sticky table header at the top of the table to always keep column [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) in sight as it makes the information users are looking for much easier to find.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Include a sticky column

Columns may include vital data that users refers to all the time. Add an option to fix the column position using a sticky column so users can always see it no matter how far they scroll horizontally. It also will help compare data from different columns more efficiently.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

## Allow items-per-page control

![[Attachments/35829c1f113da491237c6103cc0afc04_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/58249e4eb377f2bc873aebba37c19645_MD5.jpg]]

Sometimes, tables can run long and become overwhelming. Offer users the option of choosing how many items per [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) they want to see — it will help them understand and scan the table much more efficiently.

**Tip!** Avoid small item-per-page ranges and offer those that can significantly alter the page view — such as 20, 50, and 100.

## Keep the table style simple

![[Attachments/d41a2b58502c9ce47ba85e8619ce6469_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/ce0ca178d28448383ddf8c46b320dbb2_MD5.jpg]]

Tables aren't the space for getting too creative and indulging in visual decorations. Keep the table style simple and give more emphasis to the content that requires users' attention — avoid overusing italic or bold and maintain color hierarchy.

## Use zebra striping for long tables

![[Attachments/bbce9a9fce09062e8ac8b441c52af8d9_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/ceef5e35e109d9926b216851a402e821_MD5.jpg]]

Stripes are something that a zebra table style and a savanna animal have in common. A zebra-stripped table has alternating backgrounds of data rows, guiding users' eyes and enhancing scannability. They make large amounts of data look more harmonious and organized.

However, keep in mind that too much of a contrast between stripe colors can add more unnecessary visual noise.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup>

## Keep the link style familiar

![[Attachments/e7105370b88ea99a5ef57370c1cee395_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/64e5d5a45e16c04d0c679470ff7f6d7f_MD5.jpg]]

As a leopard can't change his spots, neither should you change the most familiar appearance of [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) — an underlined blue text. Doing so makes sure that it is clear to users that an item is a link that can be clicked on.

**Tip!** Make sure the link changes its color to purple once it's been selected so that users know what links they've already clicked on.

## Allow reordering

Adding an option to reorder the columns gives users the power to arrange content as they see fit. Nail it with drag-and-drop functionality — the most intuitive approach for these purposes.

**Tip!** Make sure you add enough visual cues to illustrate the drag-and-drop process, such as the cursor state transition, elevation, and shadows.

## Borders style

![[Attachments/a04443a9fb23c8e6b9ca9831cf246a55_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/47deec69b87d712399659cc5a6810dbc_MD5.jpg]]

Generally, line borders between rows and columns create visual clutter and make the design look untidy.

However, the exception is that horizontal lines can be useful in cases where the space between rows is limited, and the content is illegible without visual [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers).

## Row actions

![[Attachments/fbc63179a0da0feacff7bcdce2fe4f10_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/14a20f54a57baa905f98568b3c80fba2_MD5.jpg]]

Hover [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) are like lifeboats — you don't need them until you need them. Row actions should be invisible until users hover a mouse over the row, providing necessary functionality while saving space and reducing clutter.

One point to consider is that users won't know hover actions are there if they don't interact with the table.

## Allow bulk actions

![[Attachments/855d1cf5584c9c50a6d589f1fec3745b_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/80062ffc08cc0aec20fdc4fbc66179f1_MD5.jpg]]

Bulk actions allow filling several needs with one deed — they let users select multiple items and apply a single action to them at once.

Make sure that the multi-select [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes) are visible at all times to let users know that bulk actions are available. Once the user selects a checkbox, allow the bulk action icons to pop up visibly.

**Tip!** Keep the bulk action icons at the top of the table — a prominent and familiar place for users

## Use colors sparingly

![[Attachments/8210950c13b874af104b875aee5fcd0a_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/0e748ded6f6196eed9ff674fb67bb7ec_MD5.jpg]]

Use colors sparingly, keeping in mind visual hierarchy. Using colors for fun without purpose creates visual chaos and shifts the emphasis away from meaningful content.

## Use a consistent string format

![[Attachments/932fa109e227d6a8e07af67a733faf3b_MD5.webp]]

![[Attachments/e41b52cdd7a6c519794f34aedbf9805a_MD5.jpg]]

The human brain loves consistency. Settling on one type of string format means your user knows what to expect and immediately recognizes the string. And on the contrary, mixing string formats frustrates the user and causes unwanted friction.

## Use tabular figures

![[Attachments/a80f1d54982227c3d4a00ee6aa360148_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/ebb9fec5694932b5422e5d72b97fc1ac_MD5.jpg]]

Tabular figures refer to the font format where all digits are of the same width — for example, 1 takes as much space as 9. It makes all numbers with the same number of digits look consistently proportional, making it easier to scan and compare data.

**Tip!** If you want to keep typography consistent, choose typefaces that include tabular figures in the first place.
