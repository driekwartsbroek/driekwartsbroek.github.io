The main purpose of any chart is to present the data efficiently so that users don't need to waste their time figuring out what it means. One of the ways to do that is to make your [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) — including [fonts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts) — consistent. It helps keep users focused on the main task and increases [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility).

## Add enough white space to simplify comprehension

[White space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space) helps distinguish between the chart elements: the [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), the legend, and the chart itself. It adds balance to charts and makes them easier to scan and comprehend information.

If you have a couple of charts on a [dashboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dashboard), you should add enough [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) between them and even add borders so that users can easily distinguish different groups.

Make sure to use white space wisely. Adding too much space between elements of one group can mislead users and make them believe they're not related. That's one of the fundamental Gestalt principles of proximity.

If a [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) or an app consists of two or more charts, make sure to visually separate them. Create a [container](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container) for related items in each chart using borders or a common [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background), helping users quickly and effectively identify which elements are related.

How does it help? According to the principle of a common region, users perceive items within a boundary as a group and assume them to share some common characteristic or functionality. Thus, elements outside of these boundaries are perceived as unrelated.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Put time on the x-axis

Line charts and area charts are most commonly used to show changes in value over time. Traditionally, designers put time on the x-axis. That way, people can naturally scan your graph in chronological order.

## Make chart annotations easy to read

Chart annotations provide exact values that help users analyze graphs more effectively. Depending on the chart type, place annotations in the most convenient [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms). Avoid rotating labels or placing them against users' reading pattern.

For example, accompanying labels on the left side of each bar have an intuitive placement for left-to-right languages and are easy to read.

## Stick to standard sharp-cornered bar shapes

![[Attachments/a068e861ffed1535da11e944d4ce34e4_MD5.jpg]]

On a bar chart, bars with sharper corners help identify the value with greater precision. Bars with rounded corners might look better — use them in cases where precise visualization isn't needed. However, don't overdo it, completely round bar caps make it impossible for users to say the exact value.

## Information contrast

![[Attachments/8156b3d6ffad8fbca21b7461e4d9cee2_MD5.jpg]]

For multi-line charts, combine focused and unfocused [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states). Highlight the focused line — the one that users are hovering over — while coloring unfocused lines neutrally. Otherwise, many bright colors would distract users.

## Add visual hints

![[Attachments/327e4409906425480e6503dee1652874_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/eaa448d9c4802464d69dea4992daf7ca_MD5.jpg]]

Make analyzing a chart easier by providing hints. For example, a green arrow may indicate that the user's progress is increasing, a red one that it's decreasing, and so on. Don't rely on color only and provide other helpful signs, like [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons). For users with visual impairments, color doesn't give enough clues.

**Tip!** Make sure your hints are clear and easy to understand.

## Visual Hierarchy

Ignoring [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) can easily ruin an entire design, and charts aren't an exception. Put essential elements at the forefront, and the secondary elements will feel better in the back seat.

## Aid focus by providing contextual highlights

![[Attachments/a65907422a66ce75fc3bdf9a3e245067_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/4f340936825cf524b0aecc90270da38a_MD5.jpg]]

When users hover over a data point, emphasize its label and de-emphasize those of the other data points in order to aid focus and contextual hierarchy.

It seems like a tiny thing but it helps users analyze charts faster, paying attention to what matters and ignoring other values.

## Set charts to zero-valued baselines

![[Attachments/3c48c5922bda1779f26a8eedf6a1289e_MD5.jpg]]

When designing a chart, always keep in mind zero values. Not starting the y-axis (or x-axis for horizontal bar charts) at zero can make data appear misleading and untruthful.

For example, when the y-axis begins at 10, the bar reaching a value of 10 appears disproportionately smaller than one reaching a value of 30. By starting the axis at zero, you guarantee that data is displayed correctly and reduce the chances of users misinterpreting the data.

## Select the appropriate intervals

![[Attachments/cf043d7a7bac151a88bf644302261214_MD5.jpg]]

Selecting the right measurement intervals is essential for line and area charts. The longer the period you show, the larger intervals should be. For instance, if your chart contains over a year's worth of data, it's better to break it by months, not weeks, nor days — you'll avoid a huge amount of unnecessary data that create noise on a chart instead of valuable signals.

## Keep labels readable

![[Attachments/79f7e4a174dd242bd265f63a55ffaaf1_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/d130cd647a2e16680a39810a8215b26f_MD5.jpg]]

Using vertical or diagonal text labels might be tempting for the sake of saving space, but it doesn't make charts any clearer. Instead, it decreases readability. Orient labels horizontally, just like most other text.

**Tip!** If you have long labels, consider using horizontal bars. They allow placing long labels horizontally on the left side of the chart without hurting readability.

## Include a chart's legend for clarity

![[Attachments/3a639ce4404760d9c525bb80431ad6b5_MD5.jpg]]

A chart's legend shows which line, bar, bubble, point, or any other element represents which data series in the chart. Without it, a chart is just a set of meaningless graphics.

Obviously, you can read a single-line chart without a legend. However, when the chart involves comparisons and additional calculations, a legend is vital.

**Tip!** Make sure labels are short and straightforward enough to fit in on a mobile screen.

## Show specific values on hover

![[Attachments/abb2546c21d30f23b5d4fab8212d620a_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/49b29127095aca6b9eaa74b946b4451e_MD5.jpg]]

Not only do contextual details make a chart interactive, but they also help users understand it better. Feel free to add specific values on hover to minimize [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and help users analyze the chart or compare data in a shorter time.

**Tip!** Specific values should appear after hovering over a data point.

## Avoid distorting chart data with 3D styling

![[Attachments/431b387fe216887308bae960fa2b0c0b_MD5.jpg]]

While three-dimensional elements look great in computer games and animated movies, charts aren't really the right place for them. And it's not because they look odd. Another reason is that 3D elements make it much harder to analyze the chart and identify the exact values. It's better to stick with two-dimensional [shapes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes).

## Select the right chart type

![[Attachments/75d4b178a733b4f24bcc17d3c4e462df_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/fe91187e22cce9592a5606cbba1e2707_MD5.jpg]]

Each chart type has its own strengths and [use cases](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/use-case). **When selecting the right chart type for your project, focus on your goal, which can be to:**

-   Compare variables within groups
-   Observe changes over time
-   Show a part-to-whole relationship
-   Observe the relationship between groups
-   Look at specific geographical data<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

For example, bar or column charts are perfect for comparing different values or showing progress over time. When is it time for pie charts then? When you want your audience to have a general sense of the part-to-whole relationship — for example, voting results.

## Add tooltips on hover for better understanding

![[Attachments/891c405a7d73802cf6d6dc0565019479_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/1e8279ae10149d6db47bc14912cbf226_MD5.jpg]]

Contextual details help understand the chart better. Providing a [tooltip](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) on hover for a specific value, firstly, improves understanding of data visualization; secondly, it saves space on a graph without obscuring important information.

To benefit from them more, choose the right spot — they shouldn't cover other elements, especially the graph itself.
