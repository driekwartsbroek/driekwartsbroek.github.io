Horizontal [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) can help separate unrelated elements or emphasize the [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) between them. However, they're rarely helpful in card design. Use [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography) tools and [negative space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/negative-space) to add distance or make [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) stand out.

The fundamental rule of simplicity in card design helps get rid of visual clutter that kills [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility) and increases [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload).

## Use cards for heterogeneous items

Cards are perfect for combining heterogeneous items. By establishing boundaries or a common background, cards indicate that elements within are related and those outside are not.

Placing items of different topics within one border increases cognitive load, making users wonder if the content is related or not. Instead, split the content into logical groups to help users navigate faster.

## Make the whole card clickable

If there's only one [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) per card, feel free to make the card fully clickable. It encourages [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) and reduces effort.

**Tip!** To make the card look clickable and enhance depth, add a gentle touch of shadow or background color change.

## Use contrasting labels

When applying [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) over [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) or videos, strive for foreground vs. background [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast). Make sure people with visual impairments won't have trouble reading labels or text overlaid on images.

The golden rule is to keep the contrast ratio of 4.5:1. The trick is to place a darker cover over the image and adjust its transparency. This way, the image stays visible and contrasting enough.

**Tip!** Learn how to implement the WCAG recommendations on color contrast for accessibility in the [Color Accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/accessible-colors-417?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Use visual tools to enhance unity within a card

They're called cards because, well, they look like cards. Without visual tools like shadows, borders, shared background, each group's items look less related and create more cognitive load for users scanning a [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages).

Use clearly defined [containers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container) to help cards stand out, get more attention as a group of related content, and increase comprehension.

## Present information in a progressive way

Cards are meant for digestible pieces of content — users can open them to know more. It's an excellent example of the [progressive disclosure](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/progressive-disclosure) technique that presents information or [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) in a progressive, step-by-step way. Firstly, it helps not overwhelm novice users with bulks of content and enhances the process of system learnability. Secondly, the interface looks more organized and clear.

Keep the supporting [body text](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/body-text) short and truncate it with three dots — it gives a feeling that there's something more to explore and invites users to continue reading.

## Provide enough white space

Crammed content hinders smooth scanning and overall legibility. So back up, and give it some [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing)! When done correctly, [white space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space) is an excellent support of visual hierarchy, directing users' focus to the essential bits of content.

## Use quality media to gain trust

High-quality media says you care about users and their overall experience when interacting with a [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product). In the long run, such details impact your reputation and gain users' trust. Blurry and grainy images can be a deal-breaker, especially when they carry a vital message that users can't read.

Make sure to compress your images using tools such as [Image Compressor](https://imagecompressor.com/).

## Keep card labels concise

Card labels are a part of the product's [microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy), and good microcopy should be concise. Firstly, people don't read. Secondly, digital interfaces, especially mobiles, have limited space. You can't use long sentences simply because they won't fit anywhere.

**What can you do to make labels concise?**

-   Remove unnecessary modifying words, slang, and redundant punctuation (commas, semicolons, and clauses).
-   Avoid stating the obvious and keep your labels bite-sized, so users can quickly grasp the information and move forward.

## Maintain color hierarchy

Color hierarchy exists for a reason — it helps emphasize more relevant content and subdue elements of lesser priority. When everything on the screen is highlighted as important, nothing feels truly important, and users will find it hard to focus.

For example, the title is more relevant than a preview, and the primary button Learn More is more important than secondary [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) for adding to favorites and saving.

## Don't go overboard with styling

If the card itself already has shadows and carries high emphasis, applying shadows to your media objects, buttons, or [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) can be overkill. It divides elements and disrupts visual hierarchy.

Too many stylistic decorations overshadow the design simplicity and sharpness, making it look untidy.

## Use a familiar position for a menu icon

If your card requires more options, consider adding a kebab icon which generally sits in the upper right corner. Sometimes, you can place it in the lower corner, but keep it aligned to the right edge, as it feels more natural. Plus, the position of buttons on the right side is more convenient for users who usually operate their [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device) using their thumb.  

## Use fill mode for images

![[Attachments/029f6c8f52897a71b62477c203b023bc_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/b48e34385ac7569c57978f88f434d4c0_MD5.jpg]]

When it comes to media of different ratios, fill mode is the most visually appealing and the least risky. It sets images to fill their container while maintaining its proportions. You shouldn't bother that a part of an image gets cropped. After all, a card is just a preview of more content that users will see after clicking it. If cropping doesn't feel right, consider adjusting the image placement and scale.
