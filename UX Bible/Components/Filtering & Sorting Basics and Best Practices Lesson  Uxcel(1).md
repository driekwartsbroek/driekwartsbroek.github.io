It's much easier to find something if you know how many options are actually there. Show users a number of results and update them dynamically if filters are combined. For instance, if users select the category "sports shoes," show them sports shoes, not men's shoes in general.

## Allow to clear all filters

Sometimes, users apply tons of filters to find specific [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) but end up with a very limited list of results. Or, perhaps they change their mind and want to search for something entirely different.

It's good to have an option to remove filters one by one, but it might be difficult and time-consuming to go through all filters you've applied and remove them. Allow users to remove all filters with one click — it saves users' time and effort, especially if they shop [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile).

**Tip!** The Clear All button should appear quite subtle but do not look disabled. Make sure the button changes state on hover or click so users know they can interact with it. 

## Allow sorting when searching

Some search results may include hundreds or even thousands of items. In such cases, finding the needed [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) can become a nightmare. Fortunately, you can ease this process by allowing users to sort the results and apply filters along the way.

Many users confuse the terminology for filtering and sorting options and sometimes use them interchangeably. However, the difference is significant:

-   **Filters** set "hard" boundaries so that the [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) shows items that strictly match the specific selected criteria.
-   **The sorting** sets "soft" boundaries. Instead of excluding items, it arranges them in a specific order.

According to the Baymard Institute's studies, users often are more inclined to use sorting. The reasons for that are following:

-   **Fear of missing out (FOMO).** Users simply are afraid to lose relevant products that fall just outside their defined filter range.
-   **Not enough product details.** Users may not know well the product's domain or technical characteristics to set the filtering criteria.
-   **Not confident about their preferences.** Users may not be so sure about their budgetary limitations, compatibility requirements, usage conditions, etc., and prefer browsing until they find what they like.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

Ultimately, users need both these functionalities for finding the relevant content. You can separate them or combine them into one [UI component](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-components) if you're short of [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing).

**Tip!** Provide the most popular sorting options — by the highest and lowest price, rating, the most recent, etc.

## Number of matching results

Showing a number of search results is incredibly useful. If possible, display it not only near filters but in the Apply [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) as well. This way, you make the info more visible.

You also reduce the [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) cost — the sum of mental and physical efforts users take to reach their goals while interacting with the interface.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> For example, when the number of found items is too small or zero, users may not click the Apply button at all before removing a couple of filters to see more results.

**Tip!** Test your button width to fit the text with a three-digit number.

## Filters in mobile

Showing all available filters in the mobile app may and probably will cover other content. To avoid this, hide filters behind the button by default and place it above search results to expand on click or open into another page with filter options.

## Horizontal filter panel

If users look for cheap yellow sports shoes made in Madagascar by an ethical [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding), they'll probably apply many filters. Horizontal filter panels seem like the right solution. 

In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to the filtering sidebar, horizontal panels are more noticeable. The [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) reveals that users often tend to ignore the filtering sidebar entirely or think the sorting [tool](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) placed above the product list is the only available option for narrowing search results.

The major shortcoming of horizontal filtering is the lack of space. If your website has multiple filters, they may take a significant amount of space when expanded and force users to scroll to see results.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> The thing is, we don't need to show all filters horizontally and expand the panel to cover half of the screen. Leave the most important filters on the screen, like the [price](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/price) and brand, and hide the rest.

**Tip!** Horizontal filter panels are more common on desktop.

## Vertical filter panel

![[Attachments/12bccbcf645ab40affcc0bf2248b39f6_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/032e31ab0346e0ac3fc01da27ec8304a_MD5.jpg]]

Vertical filter panels represent the most traditional filter tool. Unlike the horizontal filter panel, the vertical one can fit all the filter groups, especially on desktop [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device). So, you can even put rarely used filters there.

Unfortunately, vertical filter panels take a lot of horizontal space and, according to the Baymard Institute research, go entirely unnoticed by users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

You should pick the filter panel type, depending on your needs, available space, and the number of filter options.

**Tip!** Adapt the vertical panel for mobile devices as you do with many other things. Otherwise, the mobile interface will look packed — and not in a good way.

## Grouping categories

![[Attachments/049ea556c0ad02f2bf2ce38f6af65b47_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/b24e30737c1a97dbb187e77a937fafcd_MD5.jpg]]

It'd be really tough to navigate through a plain filter list. You would need a second or even a third glance to find the needed parameter. That's why [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) decided to group filters by common features. Chunking and subheadings bring order in [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) and remarkably enhance scannability.

**Tip!** Negative space and/or dividers are your best friends to separate groups but maintain proximity inside group elements.

## Allow multiple selection

![[Attachments/c77f6d78576611fc4bdffc0b3a1534c7_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/c60a4cd5b637da6c3bd71d41c47d7c93_MD5.jpg]]

Most of the time, it's just impossible to find something with only one option applied inside one filter category. For example, there are a lot of things to consider while searching for a vacation lodging for a big group of friends. You may want a place to have multiple beds, allow pets, allow smoking, provide wifi, air conditioning, breakfast included, and offer various restaurants nearby to eat. Functionally, [radio buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/radio-buttons) allow only one selection, while [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes) can pull it off. Unless the options eliminate each other, checkboxes provide a more flexible search. 

**Tip!** Use visually standard checkboxes — a small square with a checkmark or an X when selected — to avoid users' confusion.

## Show most popular options upfront

Undoubtedly, users often apply price and [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) filters on a [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) store of clothes. But what about a filter like a pattern or a sleeve length? Since those filters are used less commonly, put them at the end of the filters list or cut them out completely, leaving the most popular ones at the top.

**Tip!** How do you know which are popular? Talk to your users or try the card sorting method to learn how your audience understands and categorizes information.

## Use human label naming

![[Attachments/c33f15369fd89d662dd71191ef72a09e_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/9ebec1bb8ea4c9cfa04356977e3774fe_MD5.jpg]]

The naming of categories and filter options can become a roadblock. Should you call it "fabrics" or "materials"? Do you need filters like "[Style](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style)" or "Occasion"? Your goal is to come up with widely used human names for your [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels). Talk to your users to know this information and learn what words they use. It'll make your filters sound more logical and familiar to users so they can navigate without any guesswork.

**Tip!** Look through product reviews or conduct short interviews to learn words your users actually use in conversation about products or categories. 

## Display applied filters in an overview

![[Attachments/4c99df7c2d735c178d3c5935140d0550_MD5.jpg]]

We usually strive for less in design, but sometimes, more details are inevitable. The Baymard Institute's research tells us that websites should display applied filters twice — by adding a checkmark in an option's checkbox and providing an overview.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

**For example, you can use [chips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chips) with selected options that do the following:**

-   Make users' choices more noticeable
-   Provide immediate feedback that filters are applied
-   Provide a quick way to remove filters
-   Inform users of where they are and what type of products they're viewing right now

**Tip!** In a certain way, applied filter chips work as a page title or breadcrumbs providing context and assisting in navigation.

## Consider the interaction cost

![[Attachments/8a1c57aa0e11a6b9a04ba49d0fb095df_MD5.jpg]]

Filters help users narrow the search results, remove everything that is not to the point, and find what they need much faster. A proper filter panel should display applied filters, indicate selected options, and allow users to delete selections at any time and with minimum effort and interaction cost.

The sidebar filter system may take up more space than the top inline filter system but is more scannable. Plus, it takes users only one click to remove a selection. In turn, inline filter panels take less time and may comprise more filters hidden behind the More Filters button.

Consider your product needs and select the filter panel relevant to your business segment and users.

## Show the most common options first

![[Attachments/8fbe16ee7a51f5d7201e2d9846d94721_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/6f2ec22da79f7fb0803ab1d475bf5e4c_MD5.jpg]]

If you decide to use a horizontal panel for displaying filters, be particularly careful to keep your design accurate and uncluttered. Show only the most common ones while hiding the rest under the More Filters button. Firstly, you save space for actual content. Secondly, you don't overwhelm users.

Make sure the button is visible enough, so users don't overlook it accidentally, assuming the website doesn't provide many filter criteria.

## Allow to change view options

![[Attachments/46718acf70cadd54c8b5d62a719ce36b_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/8ea8ef253e8ed9c8aee768de848e5484_MD5.jpg]]

We all perceive information differently. When users need to quickly read through as many options as possible, the list view makes more sense. In turn, the grid view provides larger [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) and short information about the product at first glance before customers decide to go to the product page for more details. By giving different view options, you introduce more flexibility. 

**Tip!** People's preference isn't the only factor. The context matters too. For instance, the map view is good for finding a cafe nearby, while the list view is for looking for the cafe with the best rating.
