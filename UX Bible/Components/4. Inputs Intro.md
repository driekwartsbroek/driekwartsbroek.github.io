# 4. Inputs Intro
## Single-Line Input

![[Attachments/2efacbc424988735d9b9c2bc5db4a29e_MD5.jpg]]

The most basic type of input is the single-line input. As the name suggests, single-line inputs allow users to type a single line. Some forms, such as signup forms requiring only users' names and [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) addresses, are built entirely with single-line inputs. They’re also suitable for collecting short answers such as addresses, [passwords](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password), occupations, and similar data.

## Multi-line Input

![[Attachments/ad180bdf7783b54db487bc18690fbd96_MD5.jpg]]

If users need to enter longer-form answers, then multi-line inputs are a better option than single-line inputs. Multiple-line inputs initially look like single-line inputs but allow users to enter longer answers, expanding vertically to fit the text as needed.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

They're an excellent option for compact [layouts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) that still require users to enter large amounts of text, for example, when collecting feedback on a survey.

## Text Area

Like multi-line inputs, text areas allow users to enter more than one line. The only difference between these input types is that the text area has a fixed height and applies vertical scrolling when text exceeds the input's bounds.

The advantage of text areas over multi-line inputs is that text areas encourage longer responses with a larger initial [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size).

**Tip!** If there is a limit to how much users can write, use helper text to indicate a character limit.

## Password Input

![[Attachments/35056d6cec7ba22f3f810ff7ad059d37_MD5.jpg]]

There are also text inputs for collecting specific types of data. Password inputs are one such type that differs from regular single-line inputs because they hide the data being entered, usually with a series of dots or asterisks.

It’s a good idea to give users the option to reveal the password they’ve entered (turning it back into real characters) if they need to check whether they’ve typed the correct password.

**Tip!** To prevent users from not complying with password requirements, include a helper text next to the label. 

## Search Input

![[Attachments/2a119c5962133fb2deb18267266a2101_MD5.jpg]]

Another special type of text input is the search input. Search inputs allow users to search the site's [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) (or beyond) and sometimes include auto-complete functionality to return the most common search results instantly. 

Search inputs are usually indicated with a magnifying glass [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons), often accompanied by a [placeholder](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/placeholder) or floating [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels). Placing the magnifying glass icon before the placeholder helps [speed](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/speed) up recognition and more efficiently guides users.

## Placeholder

![[Attachments/7572196ef3a3da763bb72ee093908a5c_MD5.jpg]]

Regardless of the type of text input, placeholder text can give users valuable insight or an example of information they're expected to enter. The placeholder text automatically disappears when the user starts entering their own content.

On complex and rarely used forms, disappearing placeholders are likely to strain users' short-term memory. If they get distracted, [switch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches) a [tab](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tabs), and then return to a form, they may not remember the hint. They'd need to remove what they've typed and click away from the input to see the placeholder text again.

To prevent such frustration, always use placeholders in combination with labels that provide an insight into what type of information users are expected to enter.

**Tip!** Make placeholder text more subtly colored than user-entered content so that users don’t mistake them for data they’ve already entered.

## Calendar Input

![[Attachments/bb76b48f0bb6d1194e89fa3746b90a74_MD5.jpg]]

Calendar inputs are text inputs with some extra formatting. While most calendar inputs allow users to enter a date manually, some also provide a calendar [dropdown](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown) for picking dates.

Any time your users need to enter a date, schedule an appointment, book a flight, buy a movie ticket, etc., using a calendar input specifically makes it easier to complete. Calendar inputs should use masks and placeholders to indicate the format of the date to be entered.

## Select Input

![[Attachments/9f4bcde25ca192b958ba4b947109df5c_MD5.jpg]]

Select inputs let users select a predefined value from a [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of options. The user simply clicks or taps on the dropdown to see a list of options. These are commonly used to select a country when filling out an address or to pick a brand or [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) when [filtering](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters) catalog options.

## Action Input

![[Attachments/01de05e5b2d69b60b602a8b7a0f8dac9_MD5.jpg]]

Action inputs include an input field and a submit button, which generally checks whether the information entered is valid or applicable. [Designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) use such inputs to verify data only in a single specific input. Users can find action inputs in a variety of places: for example, during the [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout) process when applying a coupon code or in conjunction with the Search or Send [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) to save [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) and reduce friction. 

## Required Input

![[Attachments/e16434ca69b3366e5f58da97e0f0e6cc_MD5.jpg]]

Required inputs are most commonly indicated with an asterisk or with the word "required." Letting users know which inputs are required and which they can skip over makes filling out the form a smoother, faster process.

-   **Should the asterisk follow or precede the input's label?** Putting it before the label may help users of left-to-right languages more quickly identify required inputs while scanning the form.
-   **Should the asterisk be red?** Not necessarily, but red is often associated with something that grabs attention. You can use your brand color if it's [contrasting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) enough. The only recommendation is to try to avoid pale gray that users may not even notice.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** To slightly reduce cognitive load, you may also mark optional fields with the word "optional."

## Input Mask

![[Attachments/f281081355b85440603363a2ea8948dd_MD5.jpg]]

A study by Baymard reveals that 89% of users tend to enter numerical inputs in several different ways even if the placeholder shows the formatting example.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

To prevent validation [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors), you should use input masks when proper formatting matters (such as with phone numbers or dates). It not only displays the desired input format but also auto-applies the input as the user is typing. It reduces [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and confusion, so users don't need to worry and double-check if the phone number is valid when they enter "+" or use parenthesis "()."

## Use inline validation to notify users about errors

![[Attachments/c827528cfbcffe102e5b6e7ecf66945a_MD5.jpg]]

When users fill up forms while making a purchase or booking a flight ticket, they want to stay informed about what's happening in the system. **To make the error inputs easy to notice and understand:**

-   Indicate error inputs using a prominent, contrasting color (usually red) and a relevant icon. 
-   Politely describe what happened and what users should do to fix the problem. 
-   Apply real-time, inline validation rather than submit-time [modals](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals). The latter breaks the flow and distracts users. Errors that appear immediately allow users to correct their answers before moving on.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

**Tip!** If it's a long, complex form, it may also be helpful to indicate successful inputs using a relevant color and icon.
