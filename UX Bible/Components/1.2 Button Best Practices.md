Carefully consider the [padding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/paddings) you use around a button’s [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels). Leave enough room so that the text won’t look like sardines in a can.

A good rule of thumb is to make the padding on the width twice as much as the padding on the height of the button. At minimum, an uppercase “W” should fit between the label and the edge of the button.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

On the [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web), a button's width usually adjusts according to its label.

## Use a strong visual signifier

Strong visual signifiers like [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) tell users that the button is something to pay attention to. Code red! Danger! Some colors — and by some, we mean red — are immediately associated with trouble. You can use red and similar colors for [error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) messages and destructive actions like removing or deleting.

## Let buttons breathe

If you don't want your users to click the wrong button, leave enough [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) between elements so that clickable areas don't overlap. This is particularly important for [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) interfaces, where sufficient [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) targets are vital for a good [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience).

## Stick to one style

![[Attachments/488acc3c34f38b4c724283e1d19d6708_MD5.jpg]]

Consistency is key. Stick to one [style](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style) for buttons throughout your product. Inconsistent designs confuse users and add more mental load to using your product. Consistency can be achieved through things like a single [color palette](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color-palette), [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) style, [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography), and similar design choices.

## Prioritize buttons

![[Attachments/00ee0b31d6fa0fbcb3eb1ba670ee603f_MD5.jpg]]

Think of a confirmation pop-up you've seen recently. Did you notice anything particular about the primary button? Chances are, it was styled to be more eye-catching.

Always consider [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) when applying button styling. The button for the most important or desired action should be more prominent than secondary actions.

## Align buttons with content

![[Attachments/b9991d5991844f04ab58228339f7df6c_MD5.jpg]]

Button [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment) indicates to users exactly what [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) a button is associated with, without leaving them guessing. Align buttons with the elements they're related to, and make sure to align them by their [containers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container), not their labels.

## Dropdown Button

![[Attachments/716d9baa61dc50e4b8f6a93fee22348f_MD5.jpg]]

Some buttons display a [dropdown](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown) [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) when activated (often indicated with an arrow [trailing icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/trailing-icon)). When clicked, users expect to see a standard menu, not a series of additional buttons.

## Use button hierarchy to guide users to actions

![[Attachments/0222ab0de14abcc51026168cf25ae73e_MD5.jpg]]

Hierarchy gives subtle clues to users about which is the most desirable action. When creating a button system, make sure to match the styles with each button type's importance.

For example, a primary button should stand out to users, whereas a tertiary button should be subdued and less eye-catching (they can even resemble simple text links). Secondary buttons fall somewhere in the middle.

## Branded Button

Imagine the time and effort needed to create a world-recognizable brand [logo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/logos) and associated [assets](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/assets) (such as branded buttons). Wouldn't it be a shame if someone just…ignored them?

Many brands have brand guidelines and assets that include buttons you might use to link to their products (such as apps in the app store). Follow their rules and leverage the recognizable [branding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) these companies have worked to establish.

## Style buttons without hurting legibility

Creativity is awesome, but there is a time and a place for it. When trying out a new button style, make sure to strike a balance.

The most important things to remember when styling buttons are recognizability as a button and the [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility) of the button's label. Within those guidelines, feel free to experiment.

**Tip!** Try A/B testing new button designs against more tried and true styles to gather feedback.

## Secondary button

![[Attachments/b7d007ed6b7df4492e1671cce8cfe021_MD5.jpg]]

Not all buttons correspond to a desirable action. While the primary button is used for the action you want a user to take, secondary buttons are for alternatives (such as "Cancel" buttons).

Secondary buttons should still look and feel like buttons, but just make sure to tone down their overall style. Using a lighter or gray [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) is one of the most common ways to do so.

## Button contrast

![[Attachments/b3ac20349ca3b2bebf22a10f4b20adb8_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/0ced6425a396001115c91c9471f5d6f5_MD5.jpg]]

For a button to serve its purpose, it needs to be clearly visible to users. If you put a button in front of an [image](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) or colorful background, be sure that it has enough [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) against the background for users to spot it easily. This is most commonly done by making the button’s background a different color.

## Use button shadows cautiously

![[Attachments/876d482fd0f4ef13bb2d276a2c758455_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/b2b07554b0e4a055518a192edaf95cc9_MD5.jpg]]

Soft [shadows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shadows), when used properly, can be an excellent way to create visual interest in a design and make certain elements stand out. But when designing transparent buttons or for button labels, it’s best to avoid shadows as they can make the label entirely unreadable if used in excess.

## Floating action button (FAB)

![[Attachments/c43147889bf095e81204d665a285a60e_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/e6570dad102f83aabbd01ecce268035a_MD5.jpg]]

[Floating action buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fabs) (or FABs) hover over the content. They help users perform an action in one click without leaving the main app screen.

To make FABs as useful as possible, connect them to your app's most popular and needed functionality, such as adding a post or image, or composing an [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email). That said, they should never be used for destructive actions such as deleting, signing out, etc.

## Use a familiar button's shape

![[Attachments/1ad7ab88054f7484f83ebddf1ceeb883_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/7461bbf9670233b16b4c1ca9361dedac_MD5.jpg]]

Button shape plays an important [role](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/roles) in how easily users recognize buttons. Users immediately recognize rectangular or pill-shaped buttons for what they are.

That said, you can [test](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) your creativity and step away from traditional button shapes if the project calls for it. Be sure to keep your buttons consistent throughout your interface so that users don’t have to learn new button shapes continuously.
