Breadcrumbs should show hierarchy, not session history. Displaying all of users' steps will lead only to confusion and visual clutter. Stick to the essential levels only that contain an ancestor page. If the subcategory [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) doesn't have a separate page, don't include it in the breadcrumb trail.

**Tip!** Consider shortening the breadcrumb trail for mobile and leaving the last one or two levels only.

## Each link should be easy to click

The breadcrumb trail shouldn't be too crammed. Otherwise, users will have trouble scanning the labels and pressing the right [link](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links). Give the trail some air and ensure that each link's [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) target area is at least 1cm X 1cm (44px\*44px) on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device).

## Dividers should mimic movement

In breadcrumbs, we use [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) to direct users to where they are going, not where they started. So, for the left-to-right languages, the arrows should point to the right, imitating the movement.

Left arrows are perfect for the right-to-left languages. In this case, the current page would appear on the left edge. 

## Provide a tooltip for truncated labels

If your breadcrumb trail is too long because of the labels' length, truncate them and add [tooltips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) on hover, showing the full name. Or, better yet, shorten the labels wherever possible to avoid truncation.

On mobile, tooltips don't work. NN Group recommends shortening the breadcrumb trail to include only the last level(s) and allowing access up to the immediate parent category.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Don't go overboard with breadcrumbs styling

Breadcrumbs constitute the secondary navigation, so they shouldn't be the first thing you notice when entering a page. Avoid flashy, high-contrast colors that distract users from primary navigation and the main [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). Besides, don't forget to comply with [WCAG's](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wcag) [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) requirements to make things accessible for all users.

**Tip!** Learn how to implement the WCAG recommendations on color contrast for accessibility in the [Color Accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/accessible-colors-417?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Left-align breadcrumbs to simplify scanning

Left-aligned breadcrumbs look natural to audiences reading from left to right, while center [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment) looks off and hurts [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility). The rule of thumb here is to follow the most common [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) pattern. If you align all elements on the left, breadcrumbs shouldn't be an exception.

For users reading from right to left, the alignment to the right side is the most logical decision.

## The first breadcrumb should indicate the home page

The breadcrumb trail should show a way home. Always use the homepage as a starting point to help users backtrack if they get lost. If the global navigation already has a homepage link, you can omit it in the breadcrumb trail to avoid duplication.

## Don't replace the global navigation with breadcrumbs

Too many navigation systems may overwhelm users, leaving them unable to move forward. Breadcrumbs should complement primary navigation, not replace, contradict, or overcomplicate it.

If a page provides other navigational indicators that help users identify their location (a [header](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/header) [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus), e.g.), leave a breadcrumbs trail alone.

## Breadcrumbs should only include site pages

Breadcrumb trails should only include site pages that users can visit. If the global navigation menu groups pages into logical categories (such as "Get started"), do not include them in the breadcrumb trail — they will result in multiple dead-end pages and only confuse users.
