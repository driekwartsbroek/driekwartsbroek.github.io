# Common UI Components 2
## Accordions

![[Attachments/d19b188cb62e6bbf5c77a23683977c02_MD5.jpg]]

Accordions are stacks of collapsed [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) blocks that reveal hidden content when clicked. They’re commonly used for things like FAQs, where multiple chunks of related content should be included on the same [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) but displaying them all at once could be frustrating for users to navigate. When closed, accordions only display a heading (often a question) and reveal the full content after the user clicks on it.

**Tip!** Use different icons to indicate open and closed sections.

## Lists

Grocery lists, New Year's resolutions, bucket lists — if you can name it, there's probably a list for it. In the design world, lists help arrange related elements such as text or [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images).

Lists can be ordered alphabetically, chronologically, or numerically and marked with bullets or [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons). Users love them because they're easily scannable to find the desired information.

**Tip!** Align lists and add enough white space between options for legibility.

## Breadcrumbs

![[Attachments/42b937eacc9c1b0d989aeefb8d104887_MD5.jpg]]

Breadcrumbs are a secondary [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) element that looks like a [row](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/rows) of [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links). They leave a trail to guide the user and help them back home.

The last element indicates the user's current position and the rest indicate the path they took to get there. If users travel deep down into a website and get far away from a homepage, breadcrumbs help them stay aware of their location and find their way back. The current page should always be the last crumb in the trail. ## Pagination

![[Attachments/d68819ff589ee6e495c510c879b2ed13_MD5.jpg]]

Pagination is a fundamental part of [information architecture](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/information-architecture). It is prevalent in [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) design, appearing on many web applications.

Pagination divides the content into digestible bites of pages and helps users navigate the interface. Pages are easily recognizable to users as they appear in the physical world in books, magazines, and other written materials.

Expect to see pagination on e-commerce websites or your inbox. The top and the bottom of a page are the most common places for pagination. 

## Dividers

![[Attachments/18c4c82b156e84902f57f68dbbd99a6a_MD5.jpg]]

[Designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) use [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) such as lines to separate different elements in groups of content. They support visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) and help users scan related blocks of information.

[Color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color), [white space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space), images, or [shadows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shadows) are great alternatives to lines, which can sometimes impose too much visual noise.

## Notifications

![[Attachments/880862c3ca3d2794a15b834fd1d70fdb_MD5.jpg]]

[Notifications](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications) are system messages that [alert](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts) users about updates or [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions), like a new message or a confirmation of a successfully sent [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email). They take the [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) of [badges](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/badges), [toast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/toasts) messages, or overlaying [banners](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/banners), and their primary purpose is to catch a user's attention.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Tags

![[Attachments/5021a337fa98d06bff70a6d51d0e3881_MD5.jpg]]

In the design world, [tags](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tags) are compact text elements that can serve many functions. They allow us to [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), categorize, select, [filter](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters), or trigger actions.

Google's [Material Design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/material-design) introduced the term "[chips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chips)" which is now used interchangeably with the word "tags" (although "chips" can refer to elements beyond tags as well).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> ## Date pickers

![[Attachments/54447be636e633bb6c13162cf700145f_MD5.jpg]]

A date picker is a [tool](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) for selecting a date range, a time slot, or both. When clicked, they expand into a [modal](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals) or [dialog](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs) and present users with a set of options to pick from.

The current and the selected dates should be apparent at a user's first glance. Also, don't restrict users' options — allow them to type the date instead of scrolling and picking. Sometimes, typing is much easier.

**Tip!** Disable unavailable options — for example, past or unavailable dates — to prevent user errors and friction. 

## Charts

![[Attachments/ceb2864a8125aeb67d112398137096db_MD5.jpg]]

Charts are an essential part of any [dashboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dashboard), as they allow us to visualize and compare data. They come in various forms — stacked area charts, column charts, pie charts, and many more.

Choosing the right chart type isn't just a matter of taste. It depends on how many data categories you have and the chart's purpose.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> For example, pie charts aren't a good fit for comparing more than 5 slices. It gets too crowded and hard to read for users.

## Loaders

![[Attachments/5f00c6e20bfe9a0b890da789da682fba_MD5.jpg]]

Most people don't think much about [loaders](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/loaders) until they're trying to load their Instagram feed on a 3G network. Loaders are elements that inform users about the [loading](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/loading) process. Progress bars, spinners, and skeletons are the most common ways to indicate to users that there's a delay.

**Tip!** To reduce frustration, add an explanation of why users need to wait and indicate how long it may take.

## Tooltips

![[Attachments/0b0b1b0aff66fd274c99cfe012237165_MD5.jpg]]

[Tooltips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) are short, informative messages that can't stand alone — they're always paired with interactive elements such as icons, [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), or text links. Tooltips are user-triggered and appear on a mouse hover, click, or [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards) hover. A good tooltip is short, concise, and helpful.

Don't turn tooltips into the only source of explanation. They are good companions to give an extra hand and provide additional information, but users should ideally be able to complete a task without them.

## Sliders

![[Attachments/f77e5774d8fac00d3c9accff73520e59_MD5.jpg]]

Sliders are a tool for selecting a value or a range of values. By dragging the handle (also called the "thumb") horizontally, users can set a [price](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/price) range or select a number. Some sliders contain a floating value that updates itself as users drag their thumb.

When using sliders on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile), make sure the thumb is large enough and easy to target and drag.

Keep in mind that sliders might be considerably hard to control for people with motor disabilities. Additionally, they make it difficult to fine-tune very wide ranges of values, e.g., 100 to 30k.

## Progress trackers

![[Attachments/c03f1b0f61effe1db2841adb46f6702d_MD5.jpg]]

[Progress trackers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/progress-trackers) show users how many steps they've already taken in a task and how many are left to go. They guide us step-by-step, dividing large forms into smaller chunks, and encourage them to complete each step.

Adding text to the progress tracker to indicate what each step in the process includes is helpful to users and encourages them to continue on the journey.

**Tip!** Avoid task journeys with more than 5 steps.
