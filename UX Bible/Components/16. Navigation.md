# 16. Navigation
## Horizontal tabs

![[Attachments/aa0752059f1aa02b4a6e3439ac2a0f05_MD5.jpg]]

Horizontal tabs take their inspiration from traditional file folders. Users can navigate back and forth between related groups of content easily. When a tab is selected, the [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages)’s content changes accordingly.

## Vertical tabs

Vertical tabs are more commonly used in robust [products](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) with a lot of different navigation options. They follow the same basic concept as horizontal tabs, but tabs are stacked vertically along the side of the page.

**Tip!** Avoid using more than 7-9 categories.

## Bottom tab bar/navigation

While navigation is typically located along the top of a page, in [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) apps bottom [tab bars](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tab-bar) (in [iOS](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ios) products) and bottom navigation (in [Material Design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/material-design)) are also common. These are fixed elements along the bottom of the screen on mobile interfaces. Like top navigation, they allow users to [switch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches) between different parts of an app instantly. They’re used for global navigation, so they should always remain visible. Be sure you don’t include too many tabs in this area to avoid cluttering the interface — 3 to 5 is plenty.

## Fixed tabs

Horizontal tabs come in two main varieties: fixed and scrollable. Fixed tabs have a set number of sections, all visible simultaneously.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> They’re more common on desktop interfaces, where there’s plenty of available horizontal [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) to display them. If you’re using fixed tabs on mobile [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device), be sure their [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) fit all of the devices you’re targeting to prevent breaking the interface.

## Scrollable tabs

Scrollable tabs are used when the display space is too narrow to show all of the tabs at once. Labels can be longer and you can use more tabs than you would with fixed tabs since there’s space for overflow.

**Tip!** Indicate that tabs are scrollable by half-hiding the edge tab and aligning the bar to the right.

## Nested tabs

![[Attachments/cfcab9c8d575e35ec88795dc080c1015_MD5.jpg]]

If a tab’s content could be broken down further, nested tabs can be used. They appear slightly indented relative to their parent tab and allow information to be split up into smaller chunks. Be wary of using too many nested tabs, as they can make your interface look chaotic and negatively impact [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability).

## Give tabs enough spacing

Tab spacing is important for readability and making interfaces look clean and visually appealing. Spacing between tabs should be consistent and large enough to define the relationships between elements. Additionally, each tab should have a clickable or [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) target area. It's vital that users have no trouble navigating between tabs and don't have to worry about accidentally switching between categories. 

## Add enough padding for better readability

Tab height is also vital for maintaining pleasing visuals and aiding in readability. Insufficient height makes tabs look cluttered.

Material Design guidelines specify adding at least 12px of vertical [padding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/paddings) to make labels easy to scan and identify.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> On desktop, the padding may be a bit less but make sure labels have some breathing air.

## Use appropriate tab icons

If you want to give your users a little extra help when scanning your tabs, consider using tab [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons). Icons help users identify a tab’s purpose more quickly, while also adding personality and visual appeal. Be sure to stick to simple, concrete, and familiar icons, and avoid duplicating icons for multiple tabs. Icons are best used just for primary navigation and be sure to keep [state](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) changes in mind when styling them.

**Tip!** Only use icons for primary navigational tabs and keep state changes in mind.

## Use legible label sizes

Labels are key to making tabs usable. While icons can occasionally be used alone to indicate the function of a tab, labels make tabs much more usable. Label [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) is an important element of creating readable labels. The text should be large enough to read, but not so big that it takes over as the focal point of the page. Make sure labels are consistently sized across tabs, despite label length.

## Truncate long labels

Whenever possible, use short labels — 1-2 words are enough. They’re easier to scan and format than longer labels. If you have longer labels, try to rephrase them or find a shorter alternative.

However, if it’s necessary for a label to be longer and it overflows the standard tab size, it’s better to truncate the label. Truncating helps keep [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) height consistent and simpler to scan.

**Tip!** Make sure the visible part of the truncated label explains the meaning behind this menu option.

## Highlight the selected tab

The user should always know where they are. Make sure the selected tab is highlighted so users can immediately indicate which tab is selected. [Contrasting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) color, underlines, overlays — all these [tools](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) can help the active tab stand out.

Within horizontal tabs, the current category should be connected to the content area. It allows users to differentiate selected and unselected tabs, even if navigation contains only 2 tabs.

**Tip!** Provide users at least two visual cues that the tab is selected.
