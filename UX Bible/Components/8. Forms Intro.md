Label placement plays a key [role](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/roles) in the usability of a form. [Labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) should be placed near the [inputs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) to signify their relation visually. The above-the-input label placement makes forms feel more natural to scan and read. Plus, this sort of vertical [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment) of labels and inputs better accommodates labels of varying lengths.

A simple, one-column alignment also makes it easier to transition forms to fit various screen [sizes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> Extremely long desktop forms can have labels placed on the left side of each field to save [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing). 

## Maintain a natural reading flow

One-column form [layouts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) have been shown to be considerably faster for users to complete when compared to multi-column forms.

A study conducted by the Baymard Institute reveals that users are prone to skip inputs in multi-column forms, type data in the wrong fields, get confused about how to process such forms, or simply abandon them.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Multi-column forms slow users down because they have to jump back and forth between inputs, which can even cause them to lose track of their progress within the form. A single column flows naturally from top to bottom, easing the effort users must exert.

**Tip!** Certain fields that users perceive as a coherent entity (like card number, expiration date, and CVV) can be placed in one row without confusing users.

## Use logical input grouping to reduce cognitive load

According to the principle of proximity, items that are placed near each other appear as one group and share similar attributes or functionalities. Breaking down your form into logical groups, such as personal or billing information, eases the [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and helps users complete forms faster and more effectively.

Use [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography) [tools](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) (headings, [font](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts) weight, size) and spacing to separate groups, establish a solid visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy), and make forms more scannable.

## Add enough space between elements

[Margins](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/margins) refer to the space that exists between elements. They create breathing room on the [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages), thereby helping eliminate visual clutter. If there's not enough spacing, forms feel crammed and are hard to scan.

How can you determine if a form's layout has enough spacing? Listen to your gut, and ensure that related elements are close enough together while unrelated elements sit relatively far apart.

**Tip!** Margins also maintain balance and rhythm on the page between elements.

## Create comfortable component spacing

Consistent component spacing provides rhythm and balance to your form fields. It also makes the form easier to scan and fill than a form with inconsistent spacing. Not to mention, forms with comfortable, consistent spacing appear more aesthetically pleasing. 

## Provide enough button spacing

On forms, [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) are the most important interactive elements. The form completion depends on how good the button spacing is.

Buttons need [white space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/white-space) around them to make clicking (or tapping) easier and to prevent users from accidentally interacting with the wrong button. This helps avoid irreversible [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) such as accidentally clicking on “Cancel” instead of “Submit.”

## Use progress trackers to encourage users

If your form includes at least 3 steps, such as a [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout) form or an online survey, adding a progress tracker will give users an idea of how much more of the form they have left to fill out. Breaking down forms into multiple steps or pages makes them more digestible and reduces the cognitive load required to fill them out. Besides, [progress trackers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/progress-trackers) ensure users that the end is in sight and encourage them to move forward.

## Use contextual primary action label

All forms require some kind of action. Primary action buttons should clearly [state](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) what will happen once users click or tap them through the primary action label. Only use generic action words like “submit” or “send” when other words could potentially confuse users.

At the same time, put yourself in the user’s shoes and finish the following sentence to come up with more descriptive labels — “I want to…” Your answer to this, which could include terms like “sign up” or “download,” will help you come up with the right label terminology.

## Make the primary action button stand out

The primary action [style](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style) should encourage users to click on the button. Enhance your primary action button with enough visual weight to make it stand out from any other form elements (including secondary actions) and be enticing to users.

## Make secondary buttons more subtle than primary ones

![[Attachments/50dcba629ea03d77ff59e03c0a659194_MD5.jpg]]

Secondary buttons, such as “Cancel” or “Go Back,” play supportive roles on forms. Therefore, the secondary action style should reflect their supporting nature and not steal the show from the primary action. Using lighter or less saturated [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) is a good way to make them stand out less than the primary button.

**Tip!** Be careful to not make secondary buttons look disabled.

## Provide visible and relevant error messages

When there's a problem with the [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) users have entered into a form, an [alert](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts) should notify them of this problem. Sometimes, [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) put [error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) messages above the form and call it a day. The message should be highly noticeable and relevant, and unfortunately, from this position only, users can simply overlook the problem, especially if the form is long.

Place error messages nearby the erroneous input and explain what went wrong. It helps users spot the error immediately and fix it right off the bat.
