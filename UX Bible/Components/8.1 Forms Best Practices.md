From the users' perspective, the shorter is better, especially when it comes to [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) forms. One input for a name and surname reduces [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) cost and helps finish a form a bit faster. Plus, the internet is incredibly multicultural, so creating a single field for a full name can be more inclusive. If the application displays the full name most of the time, it's doubtful it'll make the mistake of splitting the name into the wrong parts.

However, unifying the name and surname inputs isn't always a good idea. If you use users' names and surnames separately, there are chances of doing it wrong. Firstly, users may enter their full name differently and put their surname first and then their name. Secondly, if users have a middle name, your system's algorithm may also mistake splitting the full name into the wrong parts.

Most people care about their names, so using them wrong can ruin the impression and break trust. If you decide to leave only one input, make sure you know how to use it.

## Avoid dropdowns for short selection lists

![[Attachments/1988308613d6470c75e4fb7424dcaa8d_MD5.jpg]]

When asking users to select something with only 5 options or less, skip the [dropdown](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown) menu! Instead, provide simple [selection controls](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/selection-controls), such as choice [tags](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tags) (a variation of [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes)) or [radio buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/radio-buttons).

The pitfall of using [menus](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) is that they ask for extra taps or clicks, hiding options inside. For mobile users, it may turn into a nightmare — tap, scroll, select, repeat. In turn, checkboxes and radio buttons require less effort and allow users to move forward with a form faster.

## Foresee users' questions and provide helper text

![[Attachments/94c59cad9ed25c8ff31a5dca62864cf6_MD5.jpg]]

If your form asks users for private information like their phone number, they may question why it's needed. Users may also need more details when creating a new [password](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password), and using a helper text — a quick note below the input field — clarifies your intentions or requirements. Make sure the helper text is informative and briefly explains what information users are expected to enter or why the system needs this information in the first place.

Don't hide a helper text in a [tooltip](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) as it requires extra [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) unless this information doesn't influence the task completion.

**Tip!** The text should be helpful and as concise as possible.

## Use contextual keypads to minimize actions

![[Attachments/bb059af2635d2a8d120c8228f0023060_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/c95b31c8970d720c2c7ce0ce6cad2bc9_MD5.jpg]]

Providing the right keypad for the active input reduces the number of actions and engages users to complete tasks faster. For example, showing a numeric pad right away when the form asks for a phone number or [card](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) number prevents users from switching between keypads and wasting their time, especially if they're on the go.

**Tip!** Use contextual keypads in tandem with input masks to eliminate any risk of accidentally typing a wrong symbol or using the incorrect format. 

## Indicate active input state clearly

Nielsen's [heuristic](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/heuristics) on the visibility of the system's [status](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/status) [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) that a good system should inform users about what's happening and provide immediate feedback on their interaction with the interface (like clicking or tapping).

When users fill in a form, it's crucial to add a visual indication for all input states (active, focused, disabled, error) or even use a micro-interaction.

Firstly, it provides feedback on users' actions, indicating that the input is active and users can enter information. Secondly, some forms contain lots of inputs, so it helps make active ones stand out. Additionally, it encourages engagement and communicates a [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding).

## Make buttons easy to tap

![[Attachments/4d816381cb51be378e979be08f14b89d_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/6c4ce8cd2fc46ad3a50fa9c2773335aa_MD5.jpg]]

Primary [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) should lure users in and encourage them to interact. For that purpose, buttons with large [touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) areas are easier to catch [user attention](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-attention), look more engaging, and seem less error-prone.

The minimum touch target area is 1x1 cm (approximately 38px).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> It leaves some room for error even when users are moving or holding the phone and typing with one hand.

Having the same button width as the form inputs is a matter of taste, but it makes the design more balanced and just feels more satisfying.

**Tip!** Finger-friendly touch targets are vital when designing for mobile. Nothing is easier to press than a big fat button!

## Group related information

![[Attachments/9e741a885ca5589b4c029702bff07ada_MD5.jpg]]

Let's remember the Gestalt law of proximity — related [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) should be grouped together. We can interpret the law in a different way: if items sit close to each other, they're considered to belong to one topic or functionality.

How can you apply this knowledge to the design of forms? Firstly, dividing the form into logical sections helps users understand what type of information they need to provide.

Secondly, it enhances [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) and breaks the form into digestible chunks. Having imaginary "pauses" between sections reduces cognitive load and motivates users to complete a form faster.

**Tip!** Gain practical insights into implementing design principles, such as proximity, for better user experience in the [Usage of Design Principles](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/examples-755?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Use plain but informative button labels

![[Attachments/f2485a2cd93ed721530b46ecbfec226b_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/39c27bf06272b3685df419ffa2c8328a_MD5.jpg]]

Using simple language benefits all users, even experts, not to mention older adults, international users who use English as a second language, or people with reading disabilities.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

But simplicity doesn't imply sacrificing clarity, especially when it comes to button labels. Users should understand at a glance what comes next after they click the button. Vague button labels like "Ok" or "Yes" will only baffle users, make them think twice, and slow down the journey.

## Place related inputs closely

![[Attachments/f778a8e1b6755a4b639569fba0aa1d70_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/d186b4415d87853c2139bc1aef49a36c_MD5.jpg]]

Yes, a single-column [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) is generally better than a two-column layout because it doesn't interrupt the intuitive vertical movement down the form.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

However, sometimes you may find it logical to group two related inputs with very few characters and place them inline. For example, it's a good idea to combine inputs containing a city name and postal code or card number and CVV.

**Tip!** Remember to add enough spacing between inline inputs.

## Indicate optional inputs

![[Attachments/1a4a28159f888fce0f2001fa4a7273ad_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/5b1d383fa5a1099f699c78860ecfcbb6_MD5.jpg]]

Sometimes, [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) feel the temptation to stop marking required inputs hoping users will figure it out by themselves. Don't get your hopes up— if there are no markers, users assume they don't need to fill the data they feel reluctant to share, like their phone numbers or ID.

Other designers mark _only_ optional inputs since they're usually fewer. While this variant is better than nothing, there are some intricacies. If the form is long, users need to scan it and determine what information is required and what isn't. If there's only one optional field, they may miss it and make wrong assumptions. It'll result in errors and higher interaction costs and bring disappointment and confusion.

According to the Nielsen-Norman Group, marking both required and optional inputs makes a form completion a bit easier.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> The only exception is the [login](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/login) form. It's a pretty standard form, and most users know that they're expected to provide their username, phone number, or [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) and password to log in to the system.

## Inputs should be easy to hit

![[Attachments/fbd18390b4b72877ae755fb03a16015c_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/026a9ca9e9cdc7b4226b67f4af51c7cb_MD5.jpg]]

Using smaller-sized inputs might sound like a brilliant idea to save [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing), especially on mobile. However, small inputs require more effort as it's harder to hit the type area. Plus, forms with multiple tiny inputs are far more difficult to scan.

If you're afraid the form may become too lengthy and require users to scroll, break it into logical steps. The only caution is to keep the number of steps up to 5-6. Otherwise, the form may look too overwhelming.

**Tip!** Setting a height between 32px and 40px makes an input visible and clickable, but not very big at the same time.

## Clearly indicate required Inputs

![[Attachments/40213ced0aec0a88ea51bc719e49157c_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/9a7bdb7f90a0703c9b5edcebe00332aa_MD5.jpg]]

You may consider marking required fields a redundant practice which makes the form look ugly. Conversely, it works to reduce cognitive load, so users don't need to waste their time figuring out what information is obligatory.

The most common way is using an asterisk — the universal symbol to mark a mandatory input. Another way is to put the word "required" near the label.

Traditionally, the asterisk is red. It's a perfect [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) for catching user attention and indicating important areas. Avoid using muted grays or low-contrast colors as they may create an unnecessary challenge for people with visual impairments and older adults.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

**Tip!** If possible, avoid unrequired inputs and leave only mandatory ones. 

## Use placeholders cautiously

![[Attachments/488bd444280dff3e87d34e7b39bd2dca_MD5.jpg]]

The truth is placeholders often hurt [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability)**,** especially when designers try to reduce clutter on the [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) by replacing labels with placeholders. [Research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) shows that this approach strains human short-term memory.

After users have already hit the input, the placeholder disappears. Users easily get distracted, leave the window, and when returning to it later, they have to remember what information they were asked initially. To see the placeholder text again, they should remove the focus from the input and click outside of it. It's extra work, and users don't like to think or do more than necessary.

**What other traps are hidden behind placeholders?**

-   Placeholders are often used to provide an additional hint or the required data format. Users may assume the information is already filled by default and skip those inputs.
-   Eye-tracking research reveals that users' eyes get drawn to empty fields and tend to ignore inputs that already have text inside.
-   If a placeholder disappears, users need to keep in mind the required format or data type. If a placeholder stays visible, users need manually remove the text inside.
-   The pale color of placeholders can be hard to distinguish for people with visual impairments or older people.

Aren't there too many traps for a small piece of copy like this? There are two possible solutions. You can use _floating labels_ — they save space and, in [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to traditional placeholders, don't disappear, moving above the input. Unfortunately, they may be confusing and lack contrast.

Another variant is visible labels and hints placed outside empty form inputs in tandem with input masks allowing users to enter information in a format they prefer. They're familiar and straightforward, so users don't need to waste time figuring out how inputs work.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

## Use radio buttons for short lists of options

![[Attachments/6fca7f38b8c5a2890dd5da58d214c126_MD5.jpg]]

Dropdowns are for longer [lists](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) — otherwise, they're not worth the effort of so many interactions. In turn, radio buttons come in handy if you ask to make a single selection between up to 5 mutually exclusive options.

Additionally, radio buttons have lower cognitive load because their options are visible, and users can easily compare them without extra interaction cost. From the [accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accessibility) perspective, radio buttons are also easier to operate for users with motor impairments.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup>

## Place the error message near the erroneous input

![[Attachments/fcc5e90d9759b120afbf53f4c434475b_MD5.jpg]]

When it comes to placing error messages in a form, there are various options to choose from, such as left, right, above, or below the input, as well as on the top or bottom of the form. However, which placement is the most intuitive, results in the least cognitive load, and helps users identify errors faster?

According to an online study involving 303 participants, the most preferred and expected placement for error messages is on the right side of the erroneous input. Although this placement takes up more horizontal space on the form, it is still the favored choice among users. The second most popular option is to place the error message below the input because it follows the natural reading order, helps users identify errors quickly, and takes up less space. This is especially important for mobile forms.

Surprisingly, placing error messages on the top or bottom of the form can result in a higher rate of consecutive errors because users may overlook them. Additionally, these placements disrupt the natural reading flow and increase cognitive load, causing users to spend more time figuring out what went wrong.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup>

## Avoid ambiguous error messages

![[Attachments/fa2e5978abe76efd0a83202ad41bbdaf_MD5.jpg]]

Encountering an error is an unpleasant experience, and robotic wording can only make it worse. Be polite, avoid blaming tone, and write like a human being, omitting tech jargon and generic phrases. Explain shortly but clearly what went wrong and how users can fix it.

If it fits your brand personality, you can make a joke or use a witty tone to cut the tension. It can help your users relax and fix the problem without getting stressed or annoyed.

**Tip!** Explore our [Problem Messages lesson](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ux-writing/problem-messages-893) to learn more about writing polite, precise, human, and, more importantly, beneficial error messages.

## Provide informative tooltips

![[Attachments/3b0b1a7ac60739ea092a114bc93a5d53_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/5f9ddaa7a556fcff85d61592fb2c46f6_MD5.jpg]]

Sometimes, forms ask people information they don't know, or they don't know they know, like the notorious CVV/CVC code. In this case, tooltips come into play, providing a helpful good-to-know piece of information.

Commonly, tooltips appear on mouse hover or [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards) hover and are related to action-based elements ([icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons), text [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links), buttons, etc.). They should be highly contextual and briefly provide an additional explanation for an input unfamiliar to some users or a reason for why the system needs this data.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[9]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Don't include information that is vital for task completion, like password requirements, for example.

## Stick to traditional input styling

![[Attachments/5ea3dab48df3685837fc89cbf1ba2a1e_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/0e3c744b92d97cae51a5356e083293ef_MD5.jpg]]

Inputs don't usually leave much room for creativity. Keeping them simple and stylistically restrained reduces the visual clutter on the page and helps users focus on essential things.

Also, don't forget accessibility when choosing colors for labels and borders. The contrast between foreground and [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) colors can dramatically affect [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility) and the product's usability in general. If users can't read input labels or helper text, they get easily annoyed and may give up on tasks at all.

**Tip!** Learn how to implement the WCAG recommendations on color contrast for accessibility in the [Color Accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/accessible-colors-417?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Choose the right date pickers for users' needs

![Choose the right date pickers for users' needs Bad Practice](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/selecting-date-1602592684229/b-1676899730669.jpg)

![[Attachments/42e5d5294df9f24e83e38054bcf58343_MD5.jpg]]

The selection of date [pickers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pickers) for a form depends on your purposes. For example, separate dropdowns to select the day, month, and year can require an unreasonable number of interactions for something we used to remember by heart, like our birth date. A plain text input is enough for data that people can type with their eyes closed. Just be sure to use an input mask, so users don't need to worry about typing in the wrong format.

If date pickers help select dates for booking a flight or making a reservation in a hotel, a text input can be tedious. Commonly, a calendar date picker is a better control for selecting a date close to the current date by no more than a year.

**Tip!** Discover different types of date pickers and their application in the [Intro to Pickers](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ui-components-n-patterns/pickers-285) lesson. 

## Reduce the number of users' actions

According to Dr. Susan Weinschenk, a behavioral scientist, users hate when systems ask them to do more than they have to. Forms often ask for information that the system can find or do on its own. Consider methods like smart defaults or auto-detection that can identify the geolocation and pre-select a country or city. They won't cost you much but reduce user efforts and improve [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience).
