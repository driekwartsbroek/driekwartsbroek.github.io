# Common UI Components 1
## Buttons

![[Attachments/9dbf27dd2bd9316b68a901b49289f0e0_MD5.jpg]]

In digital [products](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product), buttons communicate [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) that users can take. They usually consist of a rectangular, square, or circular [shape](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes) with a label or an [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons). Buttons allow users to perform actions with a single click or tap.

A button can also be represented solely by an icon or label. Text buttons and links may look similar but they do different things. Clicking buttons changes the [state](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) of a system (either front or back end), while clicking links redirects you somewhere else and doesn't change the system's state. Plus, links often appear in the text and thus, can be longer.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Navigation components

![[Attachments/9f96b451b5ed162fb09f8f026ad2df02_MD5.jpg]]

[Navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) is the system of how users can move through an app or a website. A product's navigation should be consistent across all [pages](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages). 

Navigation may include various navigational components, for example:

-   Navigational bars
-   Sidebars
-   Breadcrumb trails
-   [Menus](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus)
-   Other [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) that help users find what they need

## Hamburger menus

![[Attachments/77bca0078feea3b226bf219cc950c126_MD5.jpg]]

The [hamburger menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hamburger-menu) is the button in websites and apps that opens up into a side menu or navigation drawer. It consists of 3 parallel horizontal strokes that can look like a simplified drawing of a hamburger to hungry people — hence the name.

## Breadcrumbs

![[Attachments/90aca079cd104f22fac69c0be899783c_MD5.webp]]

[Breadcrumbs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/breadcrumbs) are a secondary navigation element that looks like a [row](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/rows) of links separated by [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers), often chevron icons (>). Like in the tale of Hansel and Gretel, breadcrumbs leave a trail to guide users. They show users' current location and help them find their way around the product. 

The last element on the trail should be different from the rest of the path since it represents users' current position. However, it should never be a link.

## Cards

![[Attachments/461b36c460904b9ebf4a12f6299f9133_MD5.jpg]]

A card is a [UI component](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-components) that contains [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) and actions about a single subject. Cards in [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) resemble trading cards in real life — they're rectangular and often include an [image](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) and some text. They may also contain interactive elements such as Learn More or Read More buttons.

Pinterest is an excellent example of a website leveraging cards to the fullest extent.

## Checkboxes

![[Attachments/512c4921f20d892f1b0a2ec9a32bd832_MD5.jpg]]

Checkboxes are UI [selection controls](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/selection-controls) commonly found in [forms](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms). Single checkboxes are often encountered when asking for users' consent to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. When checked, they display a small box with a check mark inside. When unchecked, they appear as an empty box.

In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to radio buttons, checkboxes allow users to select several options at the same time and enable or disable each one of them.

## Containers

![[Attachments/111dff6c3a5b18a5a579f30dfee8393a_MD5.jpg]]

A container divides content into meaningful sections. Like storage containers help organize your pantry, UI containers help structure and group content.

Containers can hold text, images, or action items. Rigid containers restrict the [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) or cropping of elements within them. Flexible containers grow to support the size of the content they hold.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> That's how [responsive design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/responsive-design) works: all elements are placed inside containers to be adapted to screen size and [orientation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/orientation) and guarantee consistency across [layouts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition).

## Menus

![[Attachments/f1dcc22c68b9c6cf9d2dc262fb71dcf8_MD5.jpg]]

A menu displays a [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of multiple actions on a UI. It appears when the user interacts with a button, [tab](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tabs), or other control. Navigation menus usually include [command](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/commands) labels accompanied by icons and, sometimes, helper text.

For left-to-right languages, place icons on the left side of the label and any helper text on the right. When scanning menus, users see icons first and recognize them much faster than they read labels.

The advantage of using menus is that they provide many extra action choices without taking up much screen [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing).

**Tip!** Take our [Intro to Menus](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ui-components-n-patterns/types-i-358?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson to learn what types of menus suit different kinds of content.

## Toggles

![[Attachments/20338175cd23139c0b38547a51c6491e_MD5.jpg]]

[Toggle](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/toggles) buttons group 2 functions (sometimes 3) into a single container. In Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/human-interface-guidelines), you can encounter a similar component called segmented buttons.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

All buttons are usually equal in width. They behave like radio buttons — only one button can be selected at a time in each group. The chosen option is usually highlighted with [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) or overlays. In contrast, segmented buttons allow multiple choices.

## Inputs

![[Attachments/81a22238723740a2d4286e7dd9a03df3_MD5.jpg]]

Input fields (or just "inputs") allow users to enter text into a UI. It could be a name, [password](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password), date, time, phone number, [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email) address, or any other form of data. Inputs typically appear in forms and [dialogs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs).

## Labels

![[Attachments/5acdd0479c897e64723d6a316308a575_MD5.jpg]]

A label is a static piece of text that people can read and often copy but not edit. Labels display text throughout the interface, in buttons, menu items, and views. They aim to help people understand the current context and what they can do next. For example, within a button, a label generally conveys what the button does, such as Edit, Cancel, or Send.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Radio buttons

![[Attachments/52cbde956b31e0c9dfdf849fb62c3e13_MD5.jpg]]

Radio buttons are controls that look like outlined circles. They use a dot or solid circle inside to show the selected option. 

Unlike checkboxes, radio buttons allow users to select only one option. Once an option is picked, it can't return to the unselected state. To prevent users from being unable to undo their action, provide a "none of the above" or similar option.

## Hyperlinks

![[Attachments/da688f4dc4acf2c68e400dd9e0041b87_MD5.jpg]]

A hyperlink is a word, phrase, or image you can click on to jump to a new page or section within the current page. The text that makes up the link is known as link text, and it's usually immediately recognizable by its bright color and/or underline.
