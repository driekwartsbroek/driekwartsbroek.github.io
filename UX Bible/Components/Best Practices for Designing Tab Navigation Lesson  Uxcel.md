Horizontal [menus](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) with vertical [dividers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dividers) look incredibly clumsy, especially when there are too many tabs. Their usage is only justified when white spacing isn't enough to visually separate elements.

## Icons

When used together, the label and the [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) should complement each other, and there's no room for unclarity. If you can't find an appropriate icon for each tab of the menu, get rid of them altogether not to confuse users.

## Tabs should look and work the same

Being inconsistent in design diverts users' attention and creates unnecessary visual noise. Tabs should all look and work the same. **There are a few [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) reasons for keeping tabs consistent:**

-   It helps users recognize tabs, so they know what elements to look for when they need them.
-   It helps users predict what happens when they click tabs and be confident they will find what they expect to.
-   It enhances the chances that users complete tasks faster and more efficiently because they don't need to focus on learning how tabs work or worry about the effects of inconsistent [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature).

For example, users expect tabs to [switch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/switches) between views within the same context and don't navigate to different [pages](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages). That's pattern behavior.

**Tip!** Make sure to use a primary color to indicate the selected tab and use the same styling for unselected tabs.

## Current tab should be connected to content

When it comes to tab navigation, make sure the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) matches that of the [container](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container), while the other [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) look different. This way, you indicate the connection between the current tab and its content so users can tell which tab is selected.

## Unselected tabs should stay visible

Unselected tabs should differ from the active, but at the same time, they shouldn't look disabled or muted — otherwise, users can easily overlook or ignore them. Keeping the unselected tabs clearly visible and readable helps remind users of the additional options.

## One row tabs

Ensure that your tab navigation is a combination of meaningful sections that fit in one row. Using multiple [rows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/rows) of tabs, you risk clarity — users might assume that the second row contains sub-categories or less important tabs.

## Adhere to the parenting principle

In design, the word "parenting" is used when establishing a [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) between objects. When applied to navigation, it means that it's important to use the same direction of transition for parent and child objects. For example, if a tab changes its position from left to right, its content should move accordingly, like if you'd flip pages in a book. It gives users a sense of integrity and co-dependence between elements.

## The usage of tabs

Navigational tabs look exactly like real-world tab dividers in files or tabs on folders in a file drawer. That's why they should look and work how people expect them to. Tabs allow [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) to save space and present information in logical chunks. Thus, users don't feel overwhelmed with tons of content and can comfortably navigate it.

**When is it a good idea to use tabbed navigation in your interface?**

-   You have between 2 to 9 different categories of content
-   Category names are relatively short but meaningful
-   The number of categories is fixed
-   The categories are similar in nature and won't be perceived as site navigation
-   The categories fit in a single row<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

You shouldn't use navigation tabs if users need to compare multiple content groups simultaneously. It strains their short-term memory and remarkably increases [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload).

## Apply hover effect to indicate interactivity

When users switch between tabs and move a mouse over them, the subtle change of color or elevation informs people about the system's [status](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/status) change. Simply put, when a tab gets into focus, users receive feedback that this tab is clickable. This technique is called the hover effect. Apart from providing feedback, the hover effect makes an element and the entire interface appear more human and adds a pinch of delight to the user experience.
