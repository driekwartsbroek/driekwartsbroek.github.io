As a rule of thumb, use modals in high-stakes situations and avoid using them in all other cases.

**Use modals to:**

-   Display important [warnings](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/warning) — for example, notifying users that their system is about to restart
-   Prevent or correct critical [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) like failing to save changes
-   Confirm destructive or irreversible [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) like account deletion
-   Request information critical to continuing the current process — for example, requesting [login](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/login) credentials for users to be able to save items to their wishlists
-   Request information that will make the user experience better in the run, such as users' skill level, goals, interests, etc.
-   To simplify complex workflows for users — for example, collecting user information step by step with an onboarding/sign-up wizard

**Avoid modals for:**

-   Nonessential information not related to the current [user flow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow), like mailing [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) [signups](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/signup)
-   Interrupting high-stake processes — for example, in [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout) flows
-   Complex decision-making that requires additional sources of information unavailable in the modal — for example, offering a discount without the option to see the details<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Limit system-initiated modals

Depending on the trigger, modals can be divided into 2 types: user-initiated and system-initiated.

-   **User-initiated modals** appear on the screen after an action from users (e.g., tapping or clicking on a [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons)). Users know that these modals become visible as a result of their actions.
-   **System-initiated modals** appear after a system trigger (e.g., a timed [subscription](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/subscription) [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) or reminder to update). They interrupt users' tasks, and users might have no idea why they appeared. Avoid this type of modal unless absolutely necessary and urgent — for example, letting users know that their system is about to restart.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Put the purpose in the title

Put the modal's purpose in the title of the dialog. What are users expected to do at this point? For example, the action could be to "Leave without saving." Don't rely on the [body text](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/body-text) to convey the message because most users will skim through or skip it altogether. 

Also, make sure that your CTAs match the title. If the title is phrased as a question, the button [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) should read as possible answers to it.

## Put secondary information in the message body

![[Attachments/c8abd400aae43cc0be4b6b1882446aab_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/f7f50c9ff6106063dba5d34bd496b2fd_MD5.jpg]]

While titles introduce the modal's purpose, the body text should contain secondary information. For example, it can explain why the action is necessary or offer additional details. It should NOT repeat the title.

However, don't rely on users to read the body text. This copy is lower on visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy), and most users will skim through it. If the information is crucial and users absolutely need it to understand the purpose of the modal, put it in the title instead. 

**Tip!** Avoid passive-aggressive guilt-tripping. Instead, give clear instructions to help users complete the task or move forward.

## Use explicit button labels

Try to match the primary button label with the modal window title — it makes it easier for users to understand the context. 

The [best practice](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/best-practices) is to use an explicit button label that [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) exactly what will happen when users click it. For example, when you ask users to delete their files, instead of saying “Discard draft?” with actions “Yes” and “Cancel,” ask “Discard draft?” with actions “Yes, Discard” and “No, Cancel.”<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Add a dark overlay

Add a dark overlay to the modal to make it pop. **There are several benefits of adding dark overlays to modals:**

-   It obscures the rest of the screen, allowing users to focus on the content at hand
-   It prevents [interactions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) with elements outside the modal
-   It acts as a Close/Cancel button<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Provide multiple controls to close the modal

Modals can be overwhelming for users, no matter how well-intentioned they are. So, make sure you allow users the chance to close them as easily and intuitively as possible. **Provide multiple controls to close the modal in the form of**:

-   A Cancel button
-   A Close button
-   A [keyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/keyboards) accessible control: the Escape key on desktop and the Back button on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile)<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Allow closing the modal by clicking outside

Factoring in the possibility that users might not find your Close button, allow them to close the window by clicking outside of it. This makes exiting easy and intuitive because users will often click on the main window to go back to it.

However, you don’t want to allow users to exit this way if they’re entering information on a form — otherwise, they could lose it by accident.

## Use keyboard focus on desktop

On desktop, once the modal is open, the keyboard focus needs to be moved inside. You can put it on the primary action to encourage users to choose it. 

Users should be able to navigate the functional controls in the window using a keyboard. A colored fade-in frame can come in handy here as it adds extra visual weight to the button.

**Tip!** Allow clicking the Escape key to close the modal.

## Avoid multiple modals

Multiple modals are the stuff of nightmares — surpassed only by auto-playing ads with sound on. Avoid them at all costs. Stacked modals force users to dismiss each one at a time, which can be overwhelming and irritating. 

Also, using more than one overlay will obscure the main content. It can make users think that they have left the main window.

**Tip!** If the modal requires several steps, you can allow forward/back navigation within the modal experience.

## Avoid modals on mobile

Generally, try avoiding content-loaded modals on mobile screens. They make viewing the content difficult — they are either too large, taking up too much screen [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing), or too small. 

Catching the [fields](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) of a modal on mobile can be very difficult with pinching and zooming. Think of another way to present content — for example, on a new [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages).

## Avoid using more than two action buttons

![[Attachments/a4e1e5afcbf244153d34a52e054f8d34_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/74484f1f797f2ef00eb10c64a01f8d2f_MD5.jpg]]

Try to keep the number of actions on the modal to a bare minimum. In fact, try to keep them to two. A third action, such as Learn More, which is typically used to navigate users away from the dialog, increases the risk of users leaving the task unfinished.

## Visually emphasize the importance of alert modals

Make alert modals for critical actions highly visible to emphasize their importance. Otherwise, users might not realize how crucial the alert is and automatically dismiss it.

The [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) red is often used in [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) to grab users' attention and convey importance and urgency. It immediately stands out to us because of the ways our eyes work — about 64% of the cones in our eyes are sensitive to red light wavelengths. So, use red to convey the importance of critical or urgent [alerts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts). 

Another way to reinforce the importance of the message is by adding [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) like the circle X mark, the exclamation point, or the sad [emoji](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/emojis).

**Tip!** Explore the traditional associations of different colors and learn how to use them in the right contexts in the [Traditional Color Meanings](https://app.uxcel.com/lessons/traditional-color-meanings-879?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson.

## Use success modals sparingly

A success message is like a pat on the shoulder saying, "Great job! You're doing everything right." But it doesn't necessarily have to take the form of a modal. The better option here would be to display success states inline or on a new page.

If, for some reason, you do decide to use a success modal, remember to add a supportive text clearly explaining what the congratulations are all about and a distinct button to close the modal and move forward.
