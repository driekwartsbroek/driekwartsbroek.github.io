## Single-line list

![[Attachments/c81efae2f3cc5a853dd0411293e8995b_MD5.jpg]]

Each item in a single-line list contains only one line of text. They're the most basic list type and are seen in all kinds of interfaces.

## Multi-line list

A multi-line list pairs some primary text with a secondary description. We commonly see this in [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) results, [emails](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email), and messaging interfaces, or within things like [menus](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus).

## Rich list

Rich lists have it all. They usually contain more than just primary text and are enhanced with metadata and supporting visuals — [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons), [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images), videos, and gifs.

## Image list

Image lists present an organized grid of images to save [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) and improve visual perception. To add visual weight and increase priority, [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) can experiment with various [container](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container) [sizes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) and ratios.

## Nested list

Nested lists are lists with subcategories. Each category may include related items that expand on hover or click — similar to an [accordion](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accordions).

## Ordered list

Ordered lists present information that needs to be listed in — surprise — a specific order. They can be alphabetical, chronological, or numerical.

## Bulleted list

Lists made with bullet points are, well, bulleted lists. Bullets enhance scannability by breaking down information into items, ideas, or concepts. Whenever you want to concisely express several ideas or points, try using a bulleted list.

Along with line spacing, bulleted lists are a great tool for grabbing users' attention and improving [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility).

## Vertical list

Vertical lists are aligned along an invisible vertical line and encourage users to scroll down when opening an app or website.

## Horizontal list

Horizontal lists align items — what a shocker — horizontally. However, avoid long lists containing more options than a screen can take without scrolling, as it can cause difficulties for older people and users with motor disabilities.
