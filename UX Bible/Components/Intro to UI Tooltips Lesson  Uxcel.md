## Tooltip usage

![Tooltip usage](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/usage-1586434512290/a-1645622343991.jpg)

Good [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) should be self-explanatory. If an element already contains a descriptive [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), then there's no reason to duplicate this information in a tooltip. 

Moreover, tooltips are user-triggered and will not appear unless users interact with the elements that they are attached to, so avoid placing any information in the tooltips that are vital to the task flow. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Tooltip meaning and context

![Tooltip meaning and context](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/text-meaning-1586434539699/a-1645622376209.jpg)

The meaning and context of tooltip usage matter. Not all elements are self-evident by themselves. If there isn't any close relationship between an [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) or [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) and its meaning, use tooltips to explain their purpose.

For example, a camera icon can mean multiple things — therefore, the tooltip used to accompany it must clearly explain its function without leaving any room for misunderstandings or confusion among users.

**Tip!** Make sure your tooltips are brief and to the point. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Tooltip cursor

Change the default arrow [cursor](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cursors) to a hand pointer, aka tooltip cursor, when hovering over elements that contain tooltips. It provides visual feedback, clarifying what element the tooltip is for.

## Tooltip alignment

The purpose of a tooltip is to provide a portion of wisdom, a good-to-know piece of information — so make sure they are aligned consistently and neatly so that they are readable and easy to scan.

Sticking to a left [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment) for text is recommended as it is known to improve readability in left-to-right languages.

## Tooltip edge position

When parking, responsible drivers make sure that their car doesn't block other cars and expect other drivers to do the same. Apply the same rules to tooltips — they should be positioned accessibly without being cut off and obscured by other components.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> To do this, ensure that the tooltip edge positions are fully visible and do not overlap with other elements.

Tooltips should help, not annoy. A tooltip that overlaps other elements or blocks access to a [field](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) or a button will drive users crazy, so place them cautiously to avoid such mishaps. The idea is to make sure that a tooltip, as well as the element it is attached to are both clearly visible.

## Tooltip style

When it comes to tooltip styling, less is always more. Make sure these informative little components are easy to read and modest in style.

Extra details like framing or low-contrast text against the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) will only make it harder for users to read the hint. It is a good idea to use a moderate [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) in tooltips against the background to improve visibility and readability. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Tooltip content

Tooltips should contain only the bare minimum to ensure users have what they need. A quick rule of thumb — the tooltip [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) that helps users move forward should always be visible, easy to grasp, and not redundant. A tooltip is already a bite-sized element so don't make your users squint their eyes to read the text by including unnecessary content.
