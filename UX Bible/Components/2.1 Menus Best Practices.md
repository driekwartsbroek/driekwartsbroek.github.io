# 2.1 Menus Best Practices
## Avoid using small menus on large screens

![[Attachments/8e2f3dfa90ab0e0e126232297eb4d376_MD5.jpg]]

Avoid adding levels and hiding menu items when you have plenty of [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) to display them. It increases [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) cost and [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and delays users from finding the necessary [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions).

Put the most common options first so users don't need to scroll menus and can complete tasks a tad faster.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Add a filter or autocomplete to longer lists

For long menu lists, use a filter [input](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) or a field with autocomplete. Forcing users to scroll through many options will add a lot of unnecessary friction.

Instead, when users start typing, offer matching results if they exist. Highlight the differences, rather than highlight the characters users had already typed. This will draw attention to the query possibilities rather than to the text that is already known to users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Make selected items visible

Multiselect menus allow users to pick as many options as they want. Make sure users can see all the items they selected, and easily remove them from the menu input itself. Forcing users to go back to deselect something creates friction, so avoid such [user flows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow).

## Consider cascading menu position

Cascading menus have at least one child menu — or often multiple. Their advantage is that they allow users to choose from a large variety of choices.

Child list items appear to the right or left of parent list items. Make sure to set it up so it opens to the side where there's space to display all the options.

## Prioritize menu items

When choosing menu items, ensure you don't increase the users' cognitive load. Most people can store between 5-9 items at any time, and 2-4 of those can be processed simultaneously.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

This means that you need to consider the most important actions — create, undo, etc. — and leave them in the primary list. Less critical items can go on the second, less visible, [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) level. A menu list like this will help users spot a needed action much faster.

## Make the inline menu the same width as the input

When using inline [dropdowns](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown), make sure the menu has the same width as the input. It's logical, consistent, and visually pleasing.

## Add enough space between menu rows

Great design requires balance. Make sure the menu items are well-spaced, providing users with ample room to make a selection.

The proper [padding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/paddings) and height will increase [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility) and be more accessible for users with fine-motor-control impairments.

Follow Google’s [Material Design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/material-design) guidelines and format clickable elements to be at least 48x48 [pixels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pixels) in [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Truncate longer descriptions

Try to keep the copy simple. A menu isn’t the place for long [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) or clever wordplay. Keeping the option names straightforward and descriptive will help users find what they need quicker. 

Avoid elaborate or wordy options that look out of place and break the menu pattern. When inevitable, truncate long descriptions using [tooltips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) to reveal hidden descriptions. 

**Tip!** On mobile, when labels are too long, they might overflow to the next line. Make sure they're concise and cannot be shortened further without sacrificing clarity first. 

## Add menu elevation

Google's Material Design defines elevation as the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis. It's measured in density-independent pixels (dps) and depicted using [shadows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shadows) and [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast).

All elements have default values for resting elevation and dynamic elevation offsets. Components like menus are positioned at higher elevations than others. This is because users automatically focus their attention on the highest elevation.

Google recommends 8dp as the default elevation value for menus and sub-menus.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Make menus responsive and predictable

Menus should be responsive to users' actions — and react in a predictable manner. This means opening when clicking on the [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) or input, and closing when clicking outside of the menu.

This is a typical menu behavior that users are used to. Use the patterns they already have to work in your favor to make your menus feel intuitive.
