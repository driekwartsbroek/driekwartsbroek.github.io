# Intro to UI Loaders Lesson  Uxcel
## Circular loader

Circular loaders are one of the most popular loaders. They're easy to apply on most screens and [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device), and they generally take up little [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing). They let users know that an [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) is taking place and that something is loading.

**Tip!** Use circular loadings when loading time is short (2 to 5 seconds).

## Text loader

A text loader is a short [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) that lets users know that loading is in progress. On its own, it doesn't look stimulating, so you might want to spice things up by adding a playful [animation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/animation). 

**Tip!** Try informing users as to what will come next during a loading sequence.

## Determinate loader

Determinate loaders display the amount of time or percentage remaining. In other words, there's a clear end to the loading process.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

For added clarity, it can be helpful to let users know why they're waiting with a short accompanying text.

## Indeterminate loader

Indeterminate loaders are looped animations without a clear progress indication.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> Use such loaders for activities shorter than 5 seconds. Avoid using them for longer processes as longer looped loaders tend to drive people crazy.

**Tip!** If, for some reason, loading is taking longer than expected, break the tension with trivia or cute kitty or puppy pictures. It'll make users at least 50% happier 100% percent of the time.

## Progress bar

Progress bars look similar to the snake from the legendary Snake game. The indicator crawls along the track and fills it with [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) until the progress is complete.

**Tip!** Avoid freezing the progress bar. Instead, disguise small delays by moving the indicator at a slower speed.

## Skeleton loader

Skeleton loaders truly changed the loading game. Instead of making users wait and stare at a blank screen, skeleton loadings display a [placeholder](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/placeholder) structure of [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content). Their purpose is to reduce friction during the loading process.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Neutral colors like light grey work great for skeleton screens.

## Linear progress button

Did you know that you can place linear progress bars inside other elements — for example, in [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons)? Until the loading is complete, users can't click or tap the button.

## Text skeleton loader

Text skeleton loaders refer to rectangular placeholders that mimic the real ones and usually contain some pulse animation to reflect content loading.

## Image skeleton loader

For image skeleton loaders, we use a traditional dummy image with mountains and the sun above them. They indicate the type of content — [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) — and where it will eventually appear.

## File size loader

File [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) loaders (a type of determinate loader) are especially helpful for larger files. Seeing the file size and how much of it is uploaded or downloaded gives users a sense of progress and increases their willingness to wait.

## Inline loader

An inline loader is placed literally in line with the element to which it refers.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> Use this type of loader when there's a sequence of files or messages, such as when you upload multiple items to Google Drive. Seeing them uploaded one by one is supposed to reassure users that the loading process will be complete — sooner or later. ## Loader placement

What about loader placement? Usually, loaders take the central position of the screen when the screen content is loading. However, they can also be located near an element such as a [card](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) or an [input](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) to indicate their separate loading process.
