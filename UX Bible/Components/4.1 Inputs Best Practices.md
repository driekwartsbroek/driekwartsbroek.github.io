[Padding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/paddings) around inputs gives text enough breathing room to be read and scanned. Since users are often reluctant to fill out forms, they are more likely to complete a form if it is easy on the eyes. Generous padding not only greatly enhances [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility) but also makes forms easy to tap or click.

## Add enough space between inputs

Margins between inputs can be tricky. If there's too little space, inputs can be hard to tell apart and appear cluttered. If there's too much space, they can seem unrelated. You should find the right balance to establish a proper visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy). 

The principle of proximity [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) that related items should be close to each other to be perceived as one group. So, for example, if you're using fixed labels above inputs, the distance between an input and its label should be smaller than the distance between an input and an unrelated label.

**Tip!** When adding extra space between inputs on mobile view, make sure the page doesn't turn into endless scrolling. Consider breaking the form into several pages. 

## Avoid clutter and add enough spacing between elements

If you smash a bunch of elements together, it can create a cluttered mess of a form. Proper component spacing prevents this. Take time to organize and space your input elements in a way that allows them some breathing room while keeping them visually grouped in a logical way. The distance between inputs in a form should be larger than any spacing between component elements.

**Tip!** Add at least 4px between input borders and helper text to prevent their cramming.

## Use standard input styling for faster recognition

It can be tempting to get creative with your input [styles](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style)**.** However, it's best not to go too far. Google [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) reveals that users tend to identify the text input box faster when it has a semi-transparent fill.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

Experimenting with border radius and different colors for your inputs is generally fine, but be careful not to overdo it. Stick to the traditional input styling and don't forget that text and [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) should meet the [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) requirement of at least 4.5:1.

## Keep labels concise

Every form input you include should include a label. The label length should be kept short to avoid wasting users’ time. One or two words are generally sufficient to make your labels clear.

If an input requires a more detailed explanation, consider adding helper text or the Info [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) with a meaningful [tooltip](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips).

**Tip!** If an input requires a more detailed explanation, use the Info icon and accompany it with a meaningful tooltip. 

## Use labels to guide users

When writing label [commands](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/commands), keep in mind their primary goal — to guide users and briefly explain what information they need to provide. It requires labels to be concise, informative, and extremely clear.

Avoid technical jargon, complicated constructs, and slang. In the best scenario, unclear labels may only puzzle users for a couple of seconds. At worst, users will stumble and start questioning whether they understand what data they should provide.

Instead, keep it short, but make your instructions as straightforward as possible using everyday language.

**Tip!** For more on writing labels, explore the [Patterns in UX Writing](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ux-writing/patterns-313) lesson and learn ways to make the user experience more intuitive and friction-free through common UX writing patterns.

## Keep labels legible

![Keep labels legible Best Practice](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/label-1584969963068/a-1640770387809.jpg)

Input labels need to be easy to find and read but shouldn't draw attention to themselves. Like captions, labels represent secondary text and should be at least two sizes smaller than the [body text](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/body-text) to indicate a difference. So, if your body text is 16px, the [size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/size) of labels should be 13px or 14px.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Designing for mobile, find a way to view your designs on an actual device and check the font legibility.

## Select label case that's easier to read

The label case is important for readability. There are two common options to choose from:

-   **Sentence case:** Each word starts with a lowercase letter except for proper nouns and the first word of a sentence. Works well for both long text and short phrases like headlines or labels. It's easier to write and read, especially for lengthy [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content).
-   **Title case:** The first letter of each major word is capitalized, while the rest are in lowercase. Gives more prominence to the text and can be suitable for [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) elements such as [alert](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alerts) titles, [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) items, and labels, but may not be the best choice for long pieces of text.

Using all capital letters (ALL CAPS) for regular text is not a good idea because it's harder to read, lacks emotions, and looks unattractive. While there are some specific cases where it's acceptable, like acronyms or [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) purposes, it's generally best to avoid using all caps for longer texts to communicate effectively and make it easier for readers.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Keep the input text legible

![[Attachments/ad734918520395d72d7b672fd0367d4c_MD5.jpg]]

The input text size**,** as well as the [placeholder](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/placeholder) size, should be easy to read. There’s no single “right” size for text inputs, but 16px is a good starting point. It can be larger if you have a text-heavy [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) or slightly smaller if you design an interaction-heavy page.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Keep in mind that the legibility of different fonts can vary even at the exact same font size.

## Provide concise but meaningful helper text

![[Attachments/e13309937da983659757daefdb3bed45_MD5.jpg]]

If your input requires more nuanced information than a one or two-word label can provide, consider including helper text. You should aim to keep it concise and straight to the point and only use it when users feel confused about what information they're supposed to provide.

Remember that users don't read on the [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web), especially when it comes to [microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy), which is supposed to be short and snappy. Cut off unnecessary words that don't add to the meaning and keep the helper text up to one line.

**Tip!** Helper text should be smaller and less prominent than your label text. For example, if your labels are 14px, 12px regular is recommended for helper text.

## Provide informative placeholders

![[Attachments/f4da3ad51c6e97cc84f31c42011fc32b_MD5.jpg]]

Placeholder text is another way to clue users in on what an input should contain. Don't repeat the label's text. Instead, use placeholders to give users examples of the data they should enter. Placeholders should be colored more subtly than the input text, so users don't mistake them for data they've already entered themselves.

Placeholders can be remarkably confusing if they disappear when users place a [cursor](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cursors) inside the input. So make sure placeholders come along with labels or even consider using floating labels.
