## Simple footer

![[Attachments/3b4561f185d68de41e7951e7c09c733f_MD5.jpg]]

**The most basic type of footer is the simple footer that provides the most basic information such as:**

-   Contact information (the company's address, phone number, and link to live [chat](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chats))
-   Customer-service information
-   Privacy policy
-   Terms of use

It also might include a [logo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/logos) or copyright information. 

Simple footers don't overwhelm the rest of the site's [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design), so they are great for minimalistic websites. Another [use case](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/use-case) is single-purpose websites like [landing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/landing-page) pages.

## Rich footer

Rich footers include more information or functionality than simple footers. **Besides social media and utility links, footers can contain other components that will depend on the website's type and purpose:**

-   Global navigation (on long pages so that users don't have to scroll back to the main navigation)
-   Secondary tasks like applying for a job, finding company affiliates, etc. (on sites with multiple user groups with different user journeys)
-   A [site map](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/site-map) (on large sites with multiple levels of information or subdomains)
-   Testimonials or awards (for startups or companies with less [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) awareness)
-   Brands within the organization (large, multinational organizations with many subsidiaries or partnered brands)

**Tip!** To avoid overwhelming users, divide rich footers into columns and a maximum of two layers for the best UX.

## Mini footer

Mini footers are an alternative to traditional footers on websites with infinite scroll. The content that would have been in the footer appears in the panel on the right or within a larger, expanded global navigation.

Avoid adding the same footer for both static-length and dynamic-length pages. It will result in a frustrating game of “whack-a-mole,” where users try to click on links as quickly as possible before they vanish again.

## Layout and alignment

Another important concern in designing a footer is its [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition) and [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment). The footer should work in agreement with the [header](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/header), with the content for each aligned to the same guidelines. This helps create a structured, well-balanced layout that doesn’t distract users and increases their overall experience.

## Site map

A site map footer can include a combination of global navigation and important resources. It allows users to explore other sections or navigate directly to relevant information without returning to the top of the page.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Site maps footers are helpful for:**

-   Exposing underlying topics which are not evident at the global-navigation level
-   Increasing awareness of the site's primary content
-   Reminding users of the company's offerings

Site maps are commonly used on large multiple-level resources like 

news websites. Expect users to head to the footer when they can't find the link they are looking for.

## Social media links

Another common [feature](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) of footers is social media links. These are often included as [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) that link to the brand's Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, or other social media accounts. 

Why place social links in the footer and not the header? When users click one of those icons, they'll land on a site that does everything possible to keep these users. They can easily get distracted and forget about your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product). For this reason, 72% of the top 50 [marketing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/marketing) websites include social media icons in the footer.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Only include links to social accounts that are regularly updated. Old, outdated posts don't add to the credibility of a company.

## Partners & awards

![[Attachments/00f3aadbb7c385a5c1cf3a3bc500b602_MD5.jpg]]

For companies with less brand awareness, footers are an excellent place to build authority and credibility. You can do so by including awards, certifications, testimonials, or more well-known partner companies.

Run [usability tests](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability-testing) and A/B [tests](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) to determine if this strategy works for your footer and what's the right number of testimonials.

## Sub-brands

![[Attachments/4b3c8adb665e0d4b0980cb3024ed36c6_MD5.jpg]]

Large multinational organizations often include the links to their sub-brands in the footer. This benefits the brand in 2 ways.

First, it reinforces awareness of other brands or companies that fall under the organization’s portfolio. Second, it helps users find the best fit for their needs.
