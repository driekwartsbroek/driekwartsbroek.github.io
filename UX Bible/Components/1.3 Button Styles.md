## Sharp-corner button

![[Attachments/d2fd913124d30ed63fb59c143f7831be_MD5.jpg]]

Sharp-corner buttons — those with a border-radius of zero — give your designs a serious and sophisticated look. They look more solid and reliable.

According to the psychological Bouba/Kiki effect, over 95% of people associate edgy, jagged objects with words like "Kiki" that don't require a large opening of your lips. In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast), words that people pronounce with widely open, rounded lips, like "Bouba," are associated with curve-outlined shapes. More importantly, sharp shapes feel more rigid and severe, while soft-edged shapes felt more friendly and easy-going.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

Sharp-corner buttons may be a good solution for an insurance company website but could appear too harsh for a site selling blankets, clothing, and gifts for babies.

## Rounded button

Rounded buttons use a border radius greater than zero, giving them a smoother shape and a less formal look. Different radii convey different personalities, with rounder ones being more playful. Additionally, round shapes feel safer and are more likable.

During a study conducted by neuroscientists from the Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute at Johns Hopkins University, visitors to the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore were presented with a series of abstract [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images). After that, they were asked to vote for the most preferred and least preferred shape. The majority of visitors chose shapes with gentle curves over those with sharp points.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Rounded buttons will help you introduce the friendly personality of your [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) and ensure safety and trust.

**Tip!** Rounded buttons are easier on the eyes and look more appealing.

## Pill button

Taking rounded buttons to their extreme gives us pill buttons. They have fully-rounded ends and resemble a physical pill. They’re the most playful and friendly button shape.

To create one, just set the border radius to half the button’s height. Be sure to increase the button’s horizontal [padding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/paddings) to fit the [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) comfortably within a pill button.

## Custom button

![[Attachments/efe80b7e7ec6d52c03b6fe376030c591_MD5.jpg]]

While you’ll generally want to use buttons that are immediately recognizable as buttons, sometimes a custom button shape is worth the risk. For example, using an arrow shape for the Next button can make recognizing the button’s function easier.

Be sure that the button’s shape and styling ([color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color), [shadow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shadows), or size) reinforce its function and clarify that it is a button to prevent friction for users.

## Make your buttons accessible

Size is one of the most important aspects of button design. It is closely tied to [conversion rates](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/conversion-rate), the number of [errors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) users make, and overall [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability). When designing for [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device), you’ll want to keep the size of users’ fingers in mind when determining the button height of your buttons.

According to MIT [Touch](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/touch-target) Lab studies, the minimum touch target size is 16-20mm (~45-57px) which equals the average adult person's fingertip size.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> Notably, the impact area of an average adult's thumb is even larger — 25x25mm (72px).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

On desktop interfaces, you’ll want to provide enough top and bottom padding within your button to keep the label legible and provide plenty of area for users to click to increase [accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accessibility).

## Center labels and icons inside a button

To make your buttons look balanced and legible, always center its [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) vertically and horizontally. To prevent off-kilter icon [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment), don’t baseline-align them to the label, and always use [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) inside their [containers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/container). 

## Use icons to help users identify a button's purpose

[Research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) shows that in left-to-right languages, users scan [pages](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages), paintings, movie screens, and just about everything from the left.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup> For this reason, placing an icon on the left helps identify a button and its purpose much faster. When it appears after a button label, the icon serves only as decoration.

Additionally, placing your icons on the left will leave room on the right for a downward pointing arrow when you need a [dropdown](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown) [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus).

## Add enough padding for legibility

Padding creates a balanced and harmonious look in buttons. It enhances button emphasis and [legibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/legibility), helping direct users in the right direction. If buttons are easy to click/tap, it makes your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) accessible for people with motor or visual impairments and those with temporary disabilities.

**Tip!** For buttons, we recommend a minimum horizontal padding of 16px.

## Set minimum button's width

![[Attachments/eb61beac1ea38ea1a35ee0826f0c2c13_MD5.jpg]]

If you decide to make all buttons grow with their label, consider defining a minimum width. Overly narrow buttons may fail to reach the accessible touch/click target area size, seem disproportionate, lose emphasis, or may even fail to look like buttons.

## Apply a fixed button's width for more balance

![[Attachments/d2202c162fcc54ef9b474389ae1dce84_MD5.jpg]]

Instead of letting buttons scale with their content, you can set a fixed width to make them all the same size. This can help make groups of buttons — for example, in [modal](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals) [dialogs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs) — look balanced and pleasing.

## Maintain legible label font size

![[Attachments/bfd47e232d3f2d5fca5f0eeb228183b1_MD5.jpg]]

A button's label [font size](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/font-size) should be large enough to notice and scan. The ideal size varies across device, platform, and [typeface](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typeface), but 16px is the minimum recommended size for [body text](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/body-text). Text smaller than that can be uncomfortable for users to read and make them strain their eyes.

## Use symmetry to reduce cognitive load

If you decide to play along with traditional button shapes, follow the line! Buttons should be geometrically precise and symmetrical on at least one axis. Otherwise, they might look disordered and confuse users, creating extra [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload).

## Don't break the bond between the label and icon

![[Attachments/6492e219170af05bb0d2918e1dacb5d8_MD5.jpg]]

The [margin](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/margins) inside a button shouldn't break the bond between the label and icon. The distance between these two shouldn't exceed the button's horizontal padding — otherwise, it will look unbalanced and hurt legibility.
