In a nutshell, don't make users search for the search box — make it easily discoverable and recognizable. Hiding the search bar behind the [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) saves much [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) that designers can use for something more important. However, if searching is the website's main focus, the search bar needs to be as prominent as possible.

Besides, while hiding the search functionality behind the icon makes sense on [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) where the space is limited, it's rarely needed on desktop. Plus, it hurts [accessibility](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/accessibility) and increases the [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) cost.

People are used to seeing the search box in the top right corner of the screen, so put it there. Alternatively, you can consider placing the search bar anywhere in a [header](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/header).

## Keep the search query

How would you feel if someone took away your chair the minute you stood up? If the original search query disappears when the search results appear, it evokes a similar emotion in users.

If users don't find what they're looking for the first time, they might want to modify the query. Keep it untouched, so users can easily edit their query without retyping it and straining their short-term memory to recall the original version.

## Provide a reasonable number of search suggestions

A well-designed auto-suggestion [menu](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus) helps users choose the right option, showing up to not more than 10 relevant results. Otherwise, you risk overwhelming users instead of helping them. Suggested results aren't the right place for scrolling, so avoid it at all costs.

**Tip!** To make the auto-suggest feature even more helpful, implement autocorrection, word prediction, and related words recognition.

## Highlight matching keywords on a search results page

According to the NN Group's [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge), only 16% of people actually read the [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) on a [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) page word-by-word. What about the other 79%? They scan pages, looking for highlighted keywords, subheadings, bulleted [lists](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists), and short paragraphs.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> The thing is, the human brain is lazy and attempts to find the easiest way to complete a task.

Highlight matching keywords on the search results page to help users notice if the provided results contain the relevant information they're looking for. It makes the page look more scannable and reduces the time and effort users need to find what they seek.

**Tip!** Apply bold styling or another color for matching word parts.

## Provide a helpful No Results page

When designing the search experience, the No Results page may not be the first task you focus on, but neglecting it can become a direct cause of site abandonments. Put yourself in users' shoes and imagine how you feel if you see a blank page or a neutral "No results found," especially if it happens more than once.

If you don't want to lose users, provide a short text explaining what happens and what users can do to reach their goal. **Don't let users leave disappointed and offer them a possible solution:**

-   Offer alternative search queries
-   Provide category suggestions with [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links)
-   Suggest alternative items from a similar category
-   Recommend products based on their previous searches
-   Recommend popular products or categories

Encouraging users to check the spelling, try alternative words, or use more generic terms is better than a robotic "No Results Found." But it isn't the best solution because you force users to do extra work, and users are lazy — they don't want to spend the time reading the tips, thinking of a better query, and then trying it again without being 100% sure that this time will be successful.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> Using the right tone here can ease tension and cheer up users.

## Offer filter options

The results page contains a lot of information and can be remarkably overwhelming. Your job is to make it structured and organized so users can scan results comfortably to find what they need in the shortest time.

**There are a few rules for creating convenient [filters](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/filters):**

-   Don't intimidate users with too many filter options. Keep 5-7 options visible and hide the rest (if you have more) behind the More Filters button.
-   Prioritize filtering options and show the most common first.
-   Make it visually obvious for users what filters are currently applied and allow them to clear all filters if needed.

**Tip!** Don’t replace filtering with sorting and display both features.

## Allow users to sort items

![[Attachments/cd14c185c5d388de1dce18d3736bf13c_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/0b359ce6c3b5566e1022227370cc8d69_MD5.jpg]]

The [sorting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/sorting) option is as important as filtering for making the search results page more helpful and shouldn't be neglected. Unlike filtering, sorting doesn't narrow down the number of displayed results but changes their order for more convenience. For example, users may want to see the most popular or the cheapest items first.

**Tip!** Avoid confusing users by placing the sort feature amongst filtering options — they are different tasks.

## Choose the right pagination type

![[Attachments/cad0e282d0395a0537a6a526e9eac879_MD5.jpg]]

[Pagination](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pagination) is a [design pattern](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-patterns) that splits long lists of items into separate parts: pages. This technique significantly reduces [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and helps users navigate a results page without getting lost when looking for something specific.

There are 3 types of pagination patterns that you can apply:

-   **Traditional pagination.** Users can navigate between pages by clicking the Next or Previous Page buttons or jumping to the desired page by typing its number. This pattern is more common for desktops. Unfortunately, according to the Baymard Institute usability studies, users perceive traditional pagination as slow and discouraging from browsing the product list. The studies also show that users rarely use buttons except for Next and Previous.
-   **Infinite or endless scrolling.** Once users reach the end of the first part of the results, the website loads additional results and extends the previous list. The advantage of infinite scrolling is the reduced interaction cost, as users don't need to click or type anything to browse results. On the flip side, endless scrolling results in much lower [conversion rates](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/conversion-rate) than traditional pagination. Although users tend to scan more, it turns out that they focus less on individual products on the list.
-   **Load More pagination.** When users reach the bottom of the results page, they should consciously decide whether they want to see more results or not by clicking the Load More button. This pagination method is the least harmful to usability, although it may create obstacles for users to reach the [footer](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/footers). In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to traditional pagination, users view more products but stay more focused than when using infinite scrolling.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

Ultimately, the choice of pagination technique should be defined by your users' needs and business goals.

## Display the number of matching results

A good search page results should communicate to users if the search was successful by displaying the number of matching results. It also helps users evaluate how much time they may spend looking through results and encourage them to apply filters, sort results, or modify the search query to a more generic or more specific one.

## Highlight the suggested part in search auto-suggest

![[Attachments/720e267521671b5f30ed8d8893baaece_MD5.jpg]]

![[Attachments/1d3e6e065247534fa72c1f323303b85e_MD5.jpg]]

When you offer an auto-suggest search [dropdown](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dropdown), it's essential to differentiate the characters typed by users and the characters suggested by the system to complete the query. It helps users understand why you're offering these queries to them and helps them scan more effectively.

You can use bolding, italics, or [color](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color) to communicate the differences between these parts.

**The NN Group offers two approaches to [styling](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style) differences:**

-   If your system provides suggestions by finishing users' text and appending characters to the end, you should highlight the suggested characters.
-   If your system provides the most popular searches that contain users' text anywhere in the query, it makes more sense to highlight users' characters.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Indicate search loading with skeleton screens

![[Attachments/a925822e809478196244e741f0566891_MD5.jpg]]

Skeleton screens are an excellent technique to notify users about what's happening in the system right now. Essentially, they look like grey or neutral-toned [placeholders](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/placeholder) that appear in areas, where the actual content is not fully loaded, and disappear gradually as content loads.

It perfectly communicates to users that results may take some time to load when there's a server delay or poor internet connection. Additionally, slight [animation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/animation) on placeholders intensifies users' anticipation and adds a sense of delight to the process.

[User research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-research) involving 80 participants has proven that skeleton screens on mobile are perceived to take less time than spinners or blank pages. It also observed that participants felt happier and less frustrated when they saw skeleton screens during page [loading](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/loading).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

Skeleton screens are ideal for data-loaded pages with multiple elements loading simultaneously ([cards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards), lists). 

## Indicate search progress

Ideally, search results should be loaded immediately. However, it's not always possible, and your job is to indicate the search progress and inform users of how long it may take. Nielsen's [heuristics](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/heuristics) on the visibility of system status [states](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states) that a good product should notify users about what's going on in the system and provide feedback on users' [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) within a reasonable time.

Progress bars are a better fit when a page doesn't contain a lot of information and loading doesn't take more than 300ms. Show a progress bar or spinner and offer a short but informative explanation of the situation.

If the loading takes time, add an animation accompanied with witty [microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy) to make the waiting less boring and encourage users to stay patient.
