In 1943, Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, published _A Theory of Human Motivation_ where he proposed a psychological [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) of human needs. He suggested that people feel more motivated to perform an [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) when their needs are met in this order.

According to Maslow's hierarchy, there are 5 levels of human needs:

-   **Physiological needs** are the most basic needs, including food, drink, shelter, breathing, sex, comfort, and sleep.
-   **Safety needs** cover financial and personal security, social stability, health, law and order, emotional security, etc.
-   **Social needs** refer to human needs of belongingness, having friends, love, intimacy, families, communities, and relationships.
-   **Esteem needs** are based on feelings of recognition related to social [status](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/status), achievements, mastery, prestige, accomplishments, and respect from other individuals.
-   **Self-actualization needs** take the top of Maslow's pyramid and are associated with the realization of a person's potential, self-fulfillment, personal growth, and experiences.

Regardless of the criticism Maslow's theory received, it proved that our needs and wants determine our behavior. Maslow also pointed out that people are more inclined to satisfy their basic needs before moving on to more advanced needs.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

How does this relate to UX writing? It goes on to say that you should try to fulfill users' needs in the first place. Needs go before wants. Remarkably, there is a thin line between the two — needs refer to something that _must_ be done. Wants are just about our desire to do something or own something.

When writing, always question each line: does the copy meet any level of the psychological hierarchy? For example, the phrase "take today's lesson" calls for our willingness to learn, but it lacks enough motivation. A good example would be Duolingo's phrase, "Complete a lesson to join this week's leaderboard," which appeals to human needs of accomplishment, respect from others, and self-growth.

## What is user research?

At the end of the day, UX writers and [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) aren't users and can't be 100% confident that their [designs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) and copy are entirely intuitive and straightforward. You can walk a mile in users' shoes but still go blinded with technical wording and business jargon, forgetting that users aren't familiar with those terms. Economists Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein, and Martin Weber coined the phrase “the curse of knowledge” to describe this phenomenon. In simple terms, it’s the cognitive bias that all people around you (including your users) have the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) knowledge to understand what you mean.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Language is a subjective topic, and discussing word choice with product owners and stakeholders may not be an easy task. UX writers need valuable user research to rely on to prove them right or wrong. There are a couple of [research methods](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-methods) and tools that can help you make your UX writing perfect and compatible with your audience's mindset. A survey is one such inexpensive, quick, and easy way to obtain valuable information about users.

With a good [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of questions, you can approach a targeted group of users and receive honest opinions and in-depth insights. Surveys give you a perfect opportunity to look at actual words your audience use when talking about your product and domain.

**Tip!** Pick one topic or pain point for a survey to get more relevant and meaningful insights.

## Using Google Trends

One of the most accessible and easiest ways to make sure your words make sense is to check it on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/). Let's imagine a pretty common scenario where a UX writer is unsure about a word or has a couple of variants and doesn't know which one is the best. Google Trends may be a good way to solve the dilemma. All you do is enter the terms you have, separating them with commas, and Google Trends will compare the frequency of each term's [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) request on the Google search engine.

However, Google Trends isn't a magic pill. It can give you the most commonly sought-after words per region or country but can't assess your target audience's preferences. For example, the term "Share" may be considerably more popular but the phrasing "Tell your friends" may be more suitable for your brand's voice and could appear more appealing to users seeking social approval.

## Competitor analysis

![[Attachments/f6e2b48731aa417893ca44221bf0a9b7_MD5.jpg]]

It's always good to know your competitors, especially their strengths and pain points. Competitor analysis is one of the earliest stages of UX [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) that offers qualitative (and sometimes quantitative) insight into approaches your competitors use, which you can strategically apply to your own product.

From a UX writing perspective, you can observe their terminology and copy and [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) solutions. A word of caution — you don't know if your competitors, even if they deliver the most successful products, have tested these copy ideas. Plus, their audience may be different, and your brands may communicate different values and carry different moods. This means that what works for them won’t necessarily work for you.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Here are some recommendations for conducting an effective competitor analysis:

-   **Analyze 3-5 competing companies.** This number is usually enough to get valuable insights and not get lost in numerous content solutions.
-   **Don't blindly copy their copy solutions.** Instead, use their copy solutions as an inspiration to find something unique for your product.
-   **Create a list of comparison criteria.** It can be a simple spreadsheet with a list of comparison criteria (for example, a copy for instructions, a sign up/log in [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages), [error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) pages, [menus](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/menus), and [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), etc.) where you can analyze the tone and voice, readability, the use of active/passive voice, the sentence structure, and other essential issues. Don't forget to include your own product in the list to see how it competes with other companies.
-   **Include not just direct competitors.** Consider competitors with less successful user experience too. It'll give you a broader overview of the market and teach you what kind of UX copy to avoid in your product.

## Benchmarking voice and tone

Engaging with a digital product is so much more delightful when you feel there are people behind it. A unique and authentic voice and tone are the perfect tools for making your product sound human and connecting with your users.

So how do you find your [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) voice? What makes it so unique and appealing to the audience?

Your first step is to investigate products and brands that you like the most from completely different domains. What language do they use? How do they express sorrow, happiness, surprise, and praise? Do they sound like a professor or a friend? Do they make you laugh and smile? How do they catch your attention with a copy? Make screenshots every time you find an amusing UX copy where the product's copy rolls off the tongue and feels absolutely natural.

Once you've seen all the pros and cons of other products' [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) with users, the next step is to search for your own voice. How do you see your product? How do you want your audience to see your product? What adjectives do they use to describe it? Is it more playful and informal or prescriptive and straightforward? What emotions do you expect users to have while interacting with an app or a website and while completing tasks? Will your users like sarcastic jokes or be more inclined to a compassionate tone?

Keep [testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) and learning. It's impossible to transform your product's voice overnight and make everyone like it. It takes time and investigation. Evaluate your copy ideas and adjust the voice and tone over time as and when you get feedback from users.

## Conversational research

![[Attachments/c434113f2192185b884c6204fa971811_MD5.jpg]]

Social media has become a great outlet for people to express their frustrations, disappointments, and confusion. Forums, call center queries, reviews on App Store and Google Play, and comments on a product's page on social media are a gold mine for getting honest feedback about [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature). What's more, UX writers can learn users' vocabulary and terminology people use when talking about a product through such conversational research.

In [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) to face-to-face [interviews](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview), users behave more confidently and feel more secure to share their thoughts, even about deeply personal topics, on social media. For example, the Flo app has secret [chats](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/chats) where women can anonymously discuss reproductive issues, sex, nutrition, fitness, period cycles, and related issues with community members.

A word of caution — always support findings of conversational research with other methods. You should investigate whether users' complaints are just an issue experienced by a few users or whether it is something worth looking into. Don't change the copy until you're 100% sure.

## Observational research

![[Attachments/d52ee2c975582c94c495f03ab2012809_MD5.jpg]]

Sometimes, observation of users in their natural habitat gives UX researchers the most valuable and accurate findings. To carry out observational research, you and your team should first think of the most common places where your users live, have fun, or work. It can be a coffee shop, an art gallery, a shopping mall, or a student hall where you get a unique opportunity to watch what people do (and don’t do) and listen to what they say (and don’t say).

Observational user research consists of two main activities: observing and interviewing. While interviewing can also provide outstanding insights (e.g., on users' vocabulary), it can be inaccurate and unreliable. People don't always behave or think the way they say they do. Using observation as a conscious process that requires attention to things that can help find answers to specific questions.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

Observation usually takes place in a natural habitat of participants or, sometimes, in a testing location, like a laboratory. Sometimes, moderators observe people performing a task and ask them along the way what they are doing and what they think. In other types of observation, researchers observe without interrupting participants and take notes.

The benefit of observation for UX writing is that you can see where users stumble, feel confused, smile, or skim the text. It has great potential to indicate places where the copy can be revised.

## Qualitative interviews and research

![[Attachments/ea0f167181a87f8ae0a7a95e23d44a75_MD5.jpg]]

User interviews are one of the most popular qualitative methods of user research. Although we can't fully rely on what users say, user interviews can still provide important insights and qualitative data about users' motivations, needs, and behaviors.

What are the main recommendations for UX researchers to conduct efficient user interviews?

-   **Select 3-5 participants that represent your audience.** In contrast to quantitative user research methods (e.g., surveys), user interviews don't need large groups of people. You can interview just about 3-5 people to understand their behaviors, motivations, and opinions.
-   **Define your goals.** Research goals should reflect the purpose of user interviews. What questions do you want to answer? How can a [user interview](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interview) help you get insights? Defining goals should precede the selection of a method. It might even turn out that user interviews are not the right method for your goals.
-   **Prepare an interview guide.** This is not a script that you should follow step-by-step but a list of recommendations guiding you through an interview. Make sure that this too is in [alignment](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/alignment) with your goals.
-   **Work on interview questions.** Well-thought, open-ended interview questions are a key component of a user interview. They should help you reach your research goals and not manipulate interviewees to repeat predefined assumptions.

From the UX writing viewpoint, user interviews teach researchers user language, demonstrate their comprehension of the brand's voice and tone, and indicate roadblocks (ambiguous word choice or confusing technical terms) that impede users from moving forward and completing their tasks.
