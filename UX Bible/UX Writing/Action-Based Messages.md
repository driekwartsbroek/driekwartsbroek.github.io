## Clarity in action-based microcopy

![[Attachments/289c971f96e1829e8ce5b4e57b6eead8_MD5.jpg]]

When you hear the term "microcopy," you most certainly think of [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons). They are small but also the most important interactive elements on an interface. Buttons help users get things done, guiding and encouraging them to take action. However, buttons aren't the only elements that drive action.

[Links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) and other action-based copy help users complete their tasks. The main focus of such copy is clarity. Your copy can sound witty, easy-going, and casual, but never at the expense of clarity. After all, concise and straightforward [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) will benefit all users, including those with cognitive impairments, older adults, and international users.

Clear copy doesn't allow confusion to ooze into users' minds.

**You can call your copy clear when:**

-   The copy uses plain language and is profoundly contextual, so users don't need to think twice before pressing a button or clicking a link.
-   The sentences are short and snappy with not more than 5-8 words per sentence.
-   The text is stripped off word clusters (with regards to, in terms of, by means of, etc.), idioms, slang, technical jargon, abbreviations, double negatives, and culturally-specific references.

If you still need help understanding if the copy is crystal clear, ask your audience. If they don't stumble and have no questions about what happens after an [interaction](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction), you’ve done a good job.

**Tip!** Reading the copy aloud or asking others to read it helps writers check if the copy makes sense.

## Be direct with action-based microcopy

There's a never-ending discussion about the pros and cons of active and passive voice and its impact on readers. The opponents of passive voice argue that it makes text sound unnatural and fails to indicate who is doing the action, which can lead to [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) issues.

It is worth pointing out that native English-speaking people use the passive voice in their conversations, and it is sometimes the best choice to emphasize the action or the subject affected by this action. Plus, passive voice is much more appropriate when describing system actions.

However, active voice is undeniably the best solution for the action-based copy. It literally calls users to action and takes less time for them to understand what's going on and what they need to do. Another point to remember is that you should write in the present tense to clearly describe the corresponding action and simplify the copy. Writing in active voice is even more important for users with reading disorders or for those speaking English as a second language.

## Microcopy around CTAs

Microcopy around CTAs is usually in the [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) of a phrase or sentence users see above or below a [CTA](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/call-to-action) button or form. This copy can offer insight into what users should expect and the benefits they will receive when taking action or triggering a click. Also, it may provide some tips for completing a task more efficiently. For example, when you sign up for Instagram, the copy above the [fields](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs) says, "Sign up to see [photos](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos) and videos from your friends." This reminds users of their main goal on the app and encourages them to finish registration faster to explore [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content).

Like any microcopy, microcopy around CTAs should be concise but also snappy and informative. Some users download an app or go to a website knowing in advance what to expect and what goals they can achieve there — so they may not pay much attention to this type of CTA. Other people spend time exploring the product, and these tiny bits of text can become a critical factor that makes or breaks their whole experience.

**What else can you do to improve the UX copy around CTAs?**

-   Inject a pinch of the brand's voice by making a joke, sharing an interesting fact, or showing [empathy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/empathy). When users are in a good mood, they're more eager to act.
-   Mention security. For example, it’s a great idea to remind users on the [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout) [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) that their data is protected, or that you guarantee money return if they don't like a purchase.
-   Explain why the system needs any particular information from users or why users are required to get this form completed in the first place. For example, users may be asked for their phone numbers as part of a taxi app's verification process. It’s helpful to let them know that this information is collected to come in handy in case drivers need to contact them.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## CTA button microcopy

![[Attachments/735a9fd566d889059d93cfbab1e737bd_MD5.jpg]]

CTA buttons are usually the most prominent elements on a page. Their main goal is to catch [user attention](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-attention) and encourage them to take the desired action (sign up, buy a product or a service, subscribe to newsletters, book a demo, etc.).

On some pages, writers can unleash their creativity and experiment with CTA button labels. For example, the CTA on the Airbnb website says "I'm flexible," allowing users to explore various accommodation options without being bound to a specific location.

However, some pages, like payment or checkout, should be as mundane as possible without any creative deviations. When users see simple and clear labels such as "Confirm payment," "Place order," or "Submit purchase," they feel less worried about giving away their money or making a wrong purchase choice.

When writing copy for CTA buttons, the [best practice](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/best-practices) is to focus on users' needs and what users expect to receive when they click a button. Don't overdo choosing a unique and creative copy if your audience finds it more confusing than amusing. The CTA "Let's start the adventure" at a website offering different cloud storage plans sounds ambiguous and even ridiculous. A plain "Find a plan for you" is more appropriate in this situation.

## E-commerce microcopy

Shopping can be an entertaining and stressful activity simultaneously. Surprisingly, on average, only 1-3% of e-commerce customers make a purchase when they come to a website. One of the reasons for low [conversion rates](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/conversion-rate) is the lack of trust. Content marketers and UX writers should go the extra mile to turn visitors into buyers and persuade them to click the Checkout button.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Social proof and security can help build trust and encourage users to buy. When users browse the catalog or go to a product page, it's a good idea to notify them of how many visitors are considering buying this product right now or how many items are left in stock. This also implements the principle of _scarcity_ — that is, the human desire to possess items that are limited and thus considered more valuable than items that are easily accessible.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

It's not a secret that shopping implies spending money and providing confidential information like credit [card](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) credentials and personal details. Most people feel reluctant to share this data unless they're confident that safety is guaranteed. Words and phrases like "Secure" or "Your privacy is important to us," alongside displaying payment confirmation popups, terms and conditions, and privacy and cookies policies, tell people you value their trust.

Also, if it's possible to avoid asking users for some confidential data, use this opportunity. For example, when users can make a purchase or place an order without [signing up](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/signup) and leaving their payment information on a site, they feel more secure they won't be charged accidentally.

**Tip!** Customer reviews are another source of social approval. Motivate users to leave reviews after they buy products and display this feedback on the product page.

## User action-based onboarding microcopy

User [onboarding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/onboarding) refers to the process of introducing users to a new product or [feature](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) and helping them get familiar with it. The most popular misconception about user onboarding is that it happens only during the first interaction — once users open an app, a desktop [tool](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools), or a [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web) platform. Conversely, onboarding can take place at the sign-up phase, after registration as a welcome tour around the product, or any other time you introduce a new feature.

The most important goal of any onboarding is to introduce users to an interface or a feature and engage them in using it permanently. There's a saying that a good [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) doesn't need explanation and is intuitive enough for users to understand how to navigate a product without any extra help, but this is only partially true. Unfortunately, 20% of [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) apps get ignored or uninstalled after the first open, and onboarding is a powerful tool that can help increase retention.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> 

When done correctly, the copy guides users so they won't get lost in a new environment or functionality. Plus, it's a perfect opportunity to introduce your [brand](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding) voice and cheer users up a little.

What makes a powerful user onboarding? The key part is to focus on users' needs and show the right tips at the right time.

To start with, UX writers should concentrate on the first goals users have in mind when they start using a product or new functionality and not lead them astray with other features.

**Ask yourself questions like:**

-   What is the main value users get with our product/with this new functionality?
-   What steps should users take to obtain this value?
-   What are the friction points on the way to this main value?
-   How familiar are our long-lasting users and new users with similar products/functionalities?

One of the most useful onboarding types is to teach users by doing. Instead of giving a quick overview of all features, you can walk users through the interface, encouraging them to implement the most common tasks. For example, a taxi app can start onboarding by asking users to select where they want to go, order their first taxi, and cancel it if they change their mind or don't have the time to wait.

## Brand voice in user onboarding microcopy

Like any other microcopy, onboarding microcopy should follow best writing practices to help users get acquainted with a new product or new feature. However, onboarding is more than just about teaching functionality. It also offers a perfect opportunity to drive brand awareness and establish trust with end-users.

As a good starting point, you can create a [list](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists) of product features that impact users' interaction with an app or website. If it's just one new feature, you can also write down how this new functionality affects users' processes. The list will help you understand what core values you want to present to users and then deliver them tied up to the brand voice. For example, if your audience is mostly young adults between 18 and 21, the tone can be bold, reckless, and frisky, including jokes and witty remarks. However, if your audience is from the baby boomer generation, the tone should be more restrained and respectful.

If your product is addressed globally, you should find the right tone that does not exclude any audience group. The simple rules mentioned below can make any brand voice look and sound good:

-   **Use a conversational tone.** A dull, monotonous onboarding copy containing technical jargon or words more typical for academic writing will create the wrong impression about your product and even put off users. Before you start writing onboarding copy, have a conversation with your users and listen to what words they use to describe a product or feature.
-   **Be concise.** It may sound harsh for UX writers, but users don't read [UX copy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-writing). In fact, the better the microcopy (the focus is on the "micro" part), the lesser users get involved with it in a meaningful way — they prefer skimming it. Good onboarding copy doesn't overwhelm users but directs them. When explaining a new feature, aim for 5-8 words per sentence and stick to 1-3 sentences at most.
-   **Be respectful.** No matter how your brand voice sounds, you should always stay respectful to people belonging to different races, religions, social [statuses](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/status), genders, and income levels.

## Microcopy for modal and nonmodal pop-ups

First, let's start with the definition of pop-ups. A pop-up (also known as an overlay or popover) is a window or [dialog](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dialogs) that appears on top of the page content.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup> Pop-ups can behave like [modals](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals) and disable the content on the page, restraining users from their current task. They can also behave like non-modals, allowing users to interact with the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) content.

In general, pop-ups should be used very sparingly in interfaces and only for delivering crucial information at appropriate times. In other cases, they may appear highly intrusive and annoying. If you decide that pop-ups are the only optimal solution, make sure to implement the following recommendations:

-   **The pop-up content should be relevant.** There's nothing more annoying than a pop-up interrupting in the middle of a task or right after you log in. Give users some time and wait until the content in the pop-up becomes contextually relevant to people. For example, onboarding [tooltips](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tooltips) as non-modal overlays appear quite acceptable and can be more helpful after some time has passed and users have had a chance to interact with the interface.
-   **Be polite and highlight benefits.** People dislike pop-ups by default, so as a UX writer, you should be as respectful as possible and aim to offer evident benefits to users. For example, when asking users for their [email](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/email), you could be specific and clear about what they will get if they subscribe to your newsletter.
-   **Bring up a smile.** Pop-ups appear less annoying when they sound playful, personal, or contain an innocent joke. It's especially relevant for pop-ups that users expect to see no matter what — like overlays for cookie [notifications](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications) or modals asking for product feedback.
-   **Provide an easy exit.** Make sure your pop-ups have clear and straightforward buttons providing an easy and desirable escape.

## Microcopy for destructive actions

![[Attachments/3e9c2f0600abe1a9607ab46aa82b16e3_MD5.jpg]]

When writing for destructive actions such as account deletion or [subscription](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/subscription) cancellation, you should be particularly careful about the word choice as it can turn a simple activity into a frustrating experience.

Commonly, a confirmation popup includes two buttons: a primary button to confirm a positive action (like Save Changes or Send Message), and a secondary button to cancel it. If the primary button implies a destructive action such as canceling a subscription, what should be the label of the secondary action button that does the opposite of canceling the cancellation?

Here are a few tips that can help UX writers to avoid confusion with destructive actions:

-   **Clear and contextual title.** Commonly, users don't read — they skim content. When a popup title is similar to the primary button label, users feel more confident about what they're doing. For example, when the title says "Cancel subscription?" the primary button should confirm it saying "Cancel subscription," too. In this scenario, the secondary button can't say Cancel — otherwise, users will feel profoundly confused about what they're actually canceling now.
-   **Experiment with wording.** Your primary goal is to remove any doubts users may have when they're asked to confirm a destructive action. If you still want to keep the word Cancel for a secondary button label, consider adding the words Yes and No. For example, your copy could say, "Cancel subscription?" — "Yes, cancel" vs. "No, don't cancel." Another option is to avoid negations completely and use the word "Keep" for the secondary button. In this case, your copy would say, "Cancel subscription?” — "Keep subscription" vs. "Cancel subscription."

By any means, avoid ambiguous general button labels like Cancel vs. OK. In tandem with titles starting with the phrase "Are you sure...," they create an extra cognitive burden and force users to think more than needed.

**Tip!** If it’s suitable for your brand, you can try more casual variants like "Never mind" vs. "Cancel subscription."

## Dark patterns in action-based microcopy

![[Attachments/59fa16f1d3fcdfe9042d0026cc88a68c_MD5.jpg]]

By definition itself, the term "[dark pattern](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/dark-pattern)" doesn't convey anything positive. Dark patterns are tricks [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) and writers can use to make users perform actions they didn't plan to — like unintentionally subscribing to a newsletter. While knowing human [psychology](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/psychology) can help motivate users, dark patterns use sneaking techniques, hide information, or provide deceptive information to gain short-term wins and disrupt long-term users' loyalty and trust.

Copy is one of the most powerful tools that can persuade people into doing things they've never intended to do.

-   **Words can trigger and manipulate emotions**. Remarkably, words of emotions like sad, unfortunate, despair, sorry, or helpless can subconsciously trigger these emotions respectively. And when users feel sad or desperate, they can do anything to get happiness as quickly as possible.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>
-   **Services often resort to the technique of confirmshaming that elicits the feeling of shame and the fear of missing out**. It makes users feel uncomfortable and provokes a sense of anxiety and stress. Marketers sometimes use this approach to retain users who want to unsubscribe or delete their accounts.
-   **Words can confuse.** Double negation (Cancel Unsubscribe), passive voice ("The song should be added to your playlists to share with your friends"), generic words (" Click here," "OK," "Yes," "No," "Learn more," etc.) increase mental work and frustrate users. As a result, they may accidentally make a wrong selection and purchase what they didn't want to or subscribe to a newsletter they aren't interested in.

UX writers should be aware of the words they choose and what emotions they trigger. Dark patterns will never help you build trust among users and create a solid and successful product with a good reputation in the long run.
