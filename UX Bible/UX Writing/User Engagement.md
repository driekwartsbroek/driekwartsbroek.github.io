Today, the competition among digital products is high. UX writing is the secret ingredient to boost audience engagement for your product among the many others. The first step is to focus on understanding your users in order to craft copy that is tailored to their needs and expectations. Andrea Drugay, Copy Manager at Slack, highlights that before you start writing for a page, you should know your audience, how these people arrive at the current screen, what their needs and goals are, and what [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) you want them to perform.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

-   **[Research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) your target audience.** Before you start arranging actual words on an interface, you should know who will read them. Depending on your audience, you will have to adjust the product's tone and voice and choose words that speak to your users. To do it right, explore forums where people talk about your product or similar products or conduct [interviews](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview) to learn their expectations. If your users prefer a casual, conversational tone with a pinch of humor, get rid of complex sentence constructions and overly official language.
-   **Use human language.** Don't confuse alluring selling copy and UX writing. Words on interfaces should be straightforward and guide users — not confuse them with excessively figurative expressions. Avoid slang, tech words, or fancy academic language that forces users to think. Being clear and friendly is way more effective than using elaborate, showy vocabulary to impress your audience. Studies prove that most people, including professionals and academic staff, prefer easy-to-read content.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Tip!** Your voice and tone may be official and restrained but avoid being robotic or using negation phrases like "don't" too often. It's okay to slip in a joke here and there if you're confident it won't distract or repel your users.

## Gamification

UX writers, like UX [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer), know that understanding human [psychology](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/psychology) may help [shape](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes) user behavior and involve them in using a product. Among the many methods to do so, gamification is one that is based on behavior [design principles](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-principles). It applies game mechanics in non-game digital interfaces to evoke emotions, create a delightful user experience, and engage users.

You can't use gamification techniques without involving users' motivation. If your product's primary goal isn't a game, you should provide users some value so that they know why they participate in competitions, earn points, collect [badges](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/badges), or aim to get on a leaderboard.

What should UX writers be careful about when introducing gamification in their copy?

-   **Always remember the final goal.** Promising users badges and points for completing a task isn't enough if it doesn't motivate them to repeat the behavior again and again. If you reward users with coins for [signing up](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/signup), think of other situations where you can offer users a bonus for accomplishing a task.
-   **Tailor gamification methods to various users' needs.** What's good for advanced users may be absolutely irrelevant for newcomers. You should leverage different motivators to inspire both loyal users and those who use your product occasionally. For example, many airlines engage users to participate in miles programs which may be of no interest to non-business users.
-   **Provide simple rules and clear instructions.** Even the simplest game has its rules. Make sure your users understand what to do without extra thought work. Also, don't overcomplicate the process — games should be fun and easy after all.

**Tip!** Think twice before introducing gamification techniques. Sometimes, they can be distracting and annoying, and if most users prefer skipping the gamification part, consider removing it.

## Conversational tone

Have you noticed that some products have great functionality but create a sense of talking to a robot? UX writing can counter this and make any product feel like home. A friendly, conversational tone evokes positive emotions and builds trust. However, "conversational" doesn't mean writing goofy, [emoji](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/emojis) and slang-loaded teenager-style texts. It just means to sound human while adopting vocabulary that people generally use when talking.

What makes your writing sound conversational?

-   **First and second-person pronouns:** Third-person pronouns like "they," "he," and "she" sound formal and distant. First and second-person pronouns like "we" and "you" engage readers and direct your message to them.
-   **Informal linking words:** Linking words like "besides," "firstly," "secondly," "on the other hand," "in conclusion," etc., are more common for formal writing. In conversations, people tend to use words like "anyway," "well," "plus," "since," "of course," "because," and "also."
-   **Contractions:** People use contractions (won't, don't, aren't, etc.) in conversations to speak faster. In turn, they make writing sound more informal, as if you're talking to someone in person.
-   **Short sentences:** People commonly speak in short sentences. When used in writing, they increase readability and help users quickly understand your message.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>
-   **Use common words:** Professional jargon or elaborate vocabulary may sound impressive, but it doesn't help users achieve the goal. Aim for a readability level of 5th to 8th grade to allow most users to comprehend the content faster and more efficiently.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Clarity is vital

Every article about UX writing mentions clarity as a fundamental principle. But what does clarity imply? What kind of text can be classified as clear?

-   **Constructive:** Clear copy doesn't tolerate confusion. If your copy is effortless and users know exactly what to do, you've reached the goal. In turn, if your users see the [button](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons) [label](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels) "Cancel" and aren't sure what happens after they click it (e.g., do they cancel all changes or just close the window?), your copy has some room for improvement.
-   **Contextual:** Clear UX writing is exceptionally contextual and drives users to take action. For example, which button doesn't create any confusion and engages users to publish a photo/video to their feed — "Share" or "Submit"? Obviously, Submit is too ambiguous in this case.
-   **Concise:** Users don't like to think more than needed. And users don't read — they skim. So, review, cut, and review again until your copy is short but informative. In his book _Don't Make Me Think_, Steve Krug expertly articulates this idea: you should write like you're writing for a billboard. Imagine your users are driving 128 km per hour and can only catch a few words of copy.

**Tip!** How do you know your copy is clear? You test! Ask your audience if they understand the intended message and what happens after interacting with an element or functionality.

## Less is more

Mark Twain was remarkably right when saying: "Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words." When it comes to UX writing, it should not only be concise but also meaningful. Less is always more. Users don't read on digital interfaces. It means your copy should be on-point and snappy, so they can get the gist of it when skimming the content on the go.

It's not just that users' attention capacity requires UX copy to be short. Digital interfaces, especially mobiles, have limited [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing). You can't use long sentences simply because they won't fit anywhere.

As a rule of thumb, Nielsen-Norman Group recommends cutting off more than 50% of the words you would use in a printed publication. Remove unnecessary modifying words, slang, redundant punctuation (commas, semicolons, and clauses) that overcomplicate sentences and don't carry any value. <sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup> Cut words and then review. If the meaning doesn't get hurt, then what's the point in saying, "Are you sure you want to delete this folder?" if you can say "Delete folder?" instead?

Remember that words also get accompanied by [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) and visuals that convey information faster than words. So make sure they work in tandem and deliver the message without any fluff.

**Tip!** Incorporate UX copy early in the design stages to prevent any copy misplacement or disarray.

## Make it scannable

Scannability is the principle of arranging content in a way that allows users to scan through it quickly and understand the main message without extra guesswork. But why do UX writers need to care about scannability for UX writing which is usually concise and snappy?

The thing is, users don't read on digital interfaces and tend to ignore even short texts if they're poorly written. Using [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography) [tools](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) such as subheadings, bulleted and numbered [lists](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/lists), logical grouping, and bold and italic formatting, you can make any copy attention-grabbing and easy to skim. The easier the copy is to scan, the lesser the time users spend navigating, and the more involved they become.

**Tip!** Explore the principles and guidelines for effective typography in design in the [Typographic Principles](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/typography-basics/typographic-principles-438#scannability-6693) lesson.
