In the 1990s, Don Norman coined the term "user experience" to describe the way users interact with a product. As the discipline matured, it branched out into specialties: [UX design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-design), UX [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge), and [UX writing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-writing).

On the surface, UX writing is the art of crafting the text that appears throughout the [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) of websites, [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) apps, and other digital products. The goal of this text is to intuitively guide the user through the interface.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

On a deeper level, UX writing helps users establish a relationship with the product. Ultimately, it's about balancing user needs and business objectives.

## UX writing examples

Microcopy is what UX writers work with the most. It refers to short pieces of text on menus, [modals](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals), button labels, error messages, and other UI elements that appear on websites and apps. Microcopy is also called [UX microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy) or UX copy.

Users come to digital products for [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content), just like diners come to a restaurant for food. Microcopy influences how users consume content in the same way [table](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tables) service affects the dining experience.

Great microcopy can improve users' impression of the product. However, if the product doesn't offer real value to users, even the most amazing UX copy can't save it.

## What UX writing is not

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the differences between UX writing and related disciplines such as [copywriting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/copywriting), [content design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content-design), and [content strategy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content-strategy). Here’s what UX writing is not:

-   **Copywriting** is the most different from UX writing than other disciplines. Unlike UX writing, copywriting focuses on creating engaging content, not guiding users through it. In short, copywriting is related to [marketing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/marketing), not user experience.
-   **Content design** is more about the product's design process, while UX writing is about the words users read or hear when they're using a product — in theory. In practice, many job listings use these terms interchangeably.
-   **Content strategy** looks at a long-term strategy that uses content to achieve a particular vision. It differs from UX writing which mostly focuses on the words in a product. In practice, a content strategist and a UX writer can be the same person within an organization due to the overlap of job functions.

## Purpose of UX writing

![[Attachments/cc4777303465a161af6d3b2953dcb1de_MD5.jpg]]

UX writers work together with other UX professionals to create a seamless user experience. Indeed, a lot of it is writing microcopy, but it's more than just that. For example, instead of adding microcopy, a UX writer might change the [user flow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow) or discard a [feature](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature) altogether.

How do we know that a UX writer has done their job well? It is when the website or app feels intuitive, and users can easily find what they are looking for to complete their goals.

Coco Chanel once said, "Dress shabbily, and they remember the dress; dress impeccably, and they remember the woman." The same principle applies to UX writing. If it's terrible, users will have a bad user experience and remember what confused them. If it's excellent, they will end up remembering the product.

## Who a UX writer works with

![[Attachments/f12ba4dd0d0b89323aa479cbaf26a791_MD5.jpg]]

Working with stakeholders (developers, [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer), product managers, and marketing people) helps UX writers to understand the project's origin story and its business goals. Collaborating with the [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) team helps create designs that suit users' needs.

**It's crucial that UX writers understand:**

-   The product and its business goals
-   The audience and their needs
-   How to create a user experience to satisfy both these factors

UX writers might need to conduct [user research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-research) and [testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) in smaller companies. In bigger teams, there are separate positions for [UX researchers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-researcher), UX analysts, and related roles.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Responsibilities of a UX writer

![[Attachments/8585bd33a8eedab1aa5d1aa9bb10f06e_MD5.jpg]]

On the surface, UX writers are mainly concerned with creating clear and concise microcopy. But more than that, UX writers are an integral part of the product design team. A UX writer's responsibility is to deliver inside-out product messaging.

This includes accurate product positioning, fostering conversion, promoting transparency and user satisfaction. To achieve this, a UX writer needs to have an extensive understanding of the product, its business goals, the target audience, and the context of use.

**Besides writing microcopy, UX writers' responsibilities usually include:**

-   Collaborating with the team to create user-centric products and experiences
-   Simplifying complex concepts and language
-   Creating and using [design systems](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-systems) and [style guides](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style-guide)
-   Advocating for users
-   Educating team members about [best practices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/best-practices)
-   Conducting research and testing, and more

While most companies don't require UX writers to have a bachelor's degree, larger companies might look for candidates with degrees in English, Journalism, or [Communication](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/communication).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>
