## Playful tone

![[Attachments/9a95e699d2263f958d89978112b84592_MD5.jpg]]

Using a playful tone is a fantastic way to lighten the mood and make your [product](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product) sound like a real person! Spice things up with a pinch of humor or a witty metaphor. A playful tone in [warnings](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/warning) or [error](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/errors) [notifications](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/notifications) may soften users' hearts and make them smile instead of getting annoyed.

Keep in mind that the playful tone and jokes aren't for everyone. Make sure to know your audience before using this type of tone.

## Enthusiastic tone

Hearing (and seeing) words of encouragement helps people overcome challenges and keeps them focused on the end goal. Use an enthusiastic tone when users face obstacles, such as a lengthy [signup](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/signup) flow or a lengthy upload process. 

Do you want to sound enthusiastic? **Here are some examples of expressions you can use:**

-   Fantastic
-   Keep it up
-   Good job
-   Almost there
-   Don't give up
-   Keep going

**Tip!** Add exclamation points for more excitement.

## Warm tone

A warm tone makes your product feel more approachable and relatable. There are several components to it.

Addressing people by their first names makes a message personal and warm. Studies show that hearing one's name causes brain activation and makes people more focused and attentive.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> Another factor is using contractions — for example, "you're" instead of "you are." Without them, things can feel robotic.

When to use a warm tone? Consider adding it to the [onboarding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/onboarding) tour, sign-up process, or on the home [page](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) to greet users whenever they enter your application or website.

## Confident tone

It's crucial to sound confident when talking about serious topics — especially when sensitive or confidential data is at stake. Examples of such scenarios include [password](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password) creation or entering payment information. In these situations, you must convey that the system knows what it's doing.

**To sound confident, avoid using words and expressions that convey insecurity:**

-   Maybe
-   It seems
-   Perhaps
-   Hopefully
-   Usually
-   Probably

## Praising tone

The praising tone is close to the enthusiastic tone. Instead of encouraging users to do something, you compliment them on something they've achieved.

Studies revealed that words of praise activate the reward centers in our brains. This triggers the release of dopamine and makes people desire to experience the feeling of self-worth again and again.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

**Praise users with phrases such as:**

-   We're proud of your achievements!
-   Keep up the great work!
-   You're an amazing student!
-   You're working hard!

**Tip!** Exclamation points add encouragement. Just don't go overboard! One is enough.

## Respectful tone

To sound respectful, balance care and compassion without sounding disingenuous. A respectful tone implies a careful choice of vocabulary. Avoid using professional jargon that most users aren't familiar with. If you must use terms, provide an explanation.

To make users trust your service or product, avoid words and double entendres — phrases that are open to two interpretations. For example, "Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again."<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Another thing to avoid is jokes that might offend or hurt someone's feelings. First, only a few jokes work with a respectful tone. Second, jokes at the expense of others can repulse the audience.

## Honest tone

Honesty is a cornerstone for building a product that users love and cherish. Conveying honesty through your tone humanizes [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) and creates a relationship of mutual respect. Being honest is especially important when asking for access to sensitive data.

Be direct and avoid masking your intentions. Using active voice instead of impersonal passive voice gains users' trust and shows your brand's [ethics](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ethics).

## Friendly tone

Have you ever had a friend that immediately makes you feel in good company? A friendly tone is generally a mix of several [styles](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style) (welcoming, honest, respectful) that work together.

**What makes a product sound friendly?**

-   Conversational approach — write the way you speak
-   Informal and simple vocabulary
-   Mostly using active voice
-   Usage of personal pronouns like "you" and "we"
-   Encouraging users to take [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) with "let's" and using imperative [forms](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) ("Click it!")

We're big fans of the friendly tone here at Uxcel!

## Concise tone

A concise tone gives a lot of information clearly and in a few words; the resulting message is brief but easy to understand.

Sometimes [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) and UX writers try to say too much in one short message. But when it comes to text on the [web](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/web), less is more — especially if it concerns [microcopy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-microcopy). According to the NN Group [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge), only 16% of people read on the web word-by-word. The rest 79% scan pages picking up keywords.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

To help users scan text, remove unnecessary clutter. Sticking to one idea per paragraph reduces [cognitive load](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cognitiveload) and helps make decisions faster.

## Formal tone

![[Attachments/a14aac4a5ecf3849575010c402085ad4_MD5.jpg]]

A formal tone is expected in many work environments and educational establishments. This tone focuses on being thorough and direct yet respectful. It uses full words rather than contractions and emphasizes facts and grammatical correctness.

When aiming for a formal tone, avoid slang, idioms, and other elements of casual speech. Undoubtedly, formal language may sound dry, but it does not have to be rude; a formal tone should base on mutual respect.

Stay moderate with a formal tone. Otherwise, you will sound monotonous and lack the brand's personality.
