# Color Properties
## Hue

![[73d30939abd3d667830b6079372c3261_MD5.jpg]]

When we talk about red, green, or blue, we're talking about hue. Hue describes a color in its purest [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms), without any modifications such as adding white, black, or gray. When you look at the color wheel, hue is what you're seeing. It ranges from 0º to 359º, though there are technically infinite points on a circle (and, therefore, infinite hues).

## Shade

[Shades](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shades) occur when you add black to a pure hue.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> Shades create [contrast](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/contrast) in vibrant palettes, but be careful using them in combination with tints and light neutrals, as they can stifle the color palette and make it look dull.

Many shades — such as forest green, navy blue, or maroon — are used to create a traditional mood in design. They can give a solid, formal impression to your creative work.

## Tint

Tints are the opposite of shades — they're combinations of a pure hue with white. A tint lightens the color, but it doesn't make it brighter — it remains exactly the same color, only a paler version.

Tints can range from being slightly lighter than the original hue, all the way to off-white with barely any of the original hue present. Tinted colors appear softer and easier on the eyes, and the lightest of them are called pastels. Tints often create a youthful softer mood in a design.

## Tone

Tones are combinations of a pure hue with gray. Basically, toning a color decreases its intensity. Toned colors are generally considered more pleasing to the eye as well as complex, subtle, and sophisticated.

Subtle tones can make your designs look more mature since pure hues are sometimes considered childlike. Be wary of using too many tones, though, as they can dull your design and contribute to a boring color palette.

## Lightness

In the HSL color model (which refers to Hue, Saturation, and Lightness), lightness refers to the amount of black or white that’s mixed with the base color.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> A lightness of 0% will always be black, regardless of the starting color. A lightness of 100% will always be white, regardless of the base color or saturation.

## Value

In the HSV color model (referring to Hue, Saturation, and Value), value refers to how much black is mixed with the base hue.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup> When the value is 0%, the color is always black. When the value is 100%, the color will be super vibrant, except when the saturation is 0% — then the color will be white. Value is also called brightness in the HSB color model. Note that while value and brightness are synonyms, lightness is a different thing.

## Saturation

When talking about the intensity of a color, you’re talking about saturation. Saturation defines a range from pure color (100%) to gray (0%) and indicates how vibrant or dull a color looks. Colors that are fully saturated appear vivid and bright, while those with low saturation look faded.

When a color is fully desaturated, we end up with gray. Less saturated colors can create a calming effect in your design, but be careful that your palette doesn't end up boring.

**Tip!** Use less saturated colors to create a calming effect in designs.

## Opacity

Opacity measures how opaque a color is. When opacity is 0%, the color is completely transparent; when it’s 100%, it’s completely opaque.

Opacity can be used to stack layers of colors, creating interesting new colors. It can also be used as an overlay for [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) to add a particular tint to the image.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>
