Studies have shown that blue is the most universally favored color, and it's been that way since early color [psychology](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/psychology) studies in the 1940s.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> A survey conducted in 2015 revealed that blue is the most popular color across all countries, genders, ages, races, and even political affiliations.

Between 23% (in Indonesia) and 33% (in Great Britain) of people like blue most out of the colors listed, putting it far ahead of any other color. Blue even wins in Asia, where colors like red, yellow, and green are traditionally loved. Blue tends to be more popular with men than women, but women still like blue more than any other color.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

According to the ecological valence theory, our color preferences are determined by the color of things we like. If you look at things associated with blue, like the sky and water, they mostly hold positive associations.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Naturally, blue is a safe color choice in any environment or demographic. Just check out big digital companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Skype that use blue in their [branding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding). Stores of companies like GM, Ford, Intel, Boeing, and Walmart also leverage blue's universality.

## Pan-Arab colors

![[32e17e01424eb5d9e4d9fed69f0fed80_MD5.jpg]]

The Pan-Arab colors are black, white, green, and red. Individually, they each represent a historical Arab dynasty or era.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> These colors have significance across the Middle East and are used in many Arab countries' flags across the region.

In a 2013 color marketing study in Saudi Arabia, participants chose black and white as their favorite colors, which they associated with high quality.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup> Green is mainly associated with peace, wealth, agriculture, and prosperity. Red isn't used on its own very much but works together with the entire palette.

## Pan-African colors

![[c8f1c72b228dcce7baa746545eecba40_MD5.jpg]]

Ethiopia's new flag, created in 1897, was a red, yellow, and green tricolor, which became the symbol of resistance against foreign occupation. Newly independent countries would use these colors in their flags. Another variation of the Pan-African color scheme was developed later. It includes red, green, and black.

The meaning of the individual colors varies from country to country. Generally, their meanings are as follows:

-   **Green** represents the land, hope, growth, and natural fertility.
-   **Red** represents the blood spilled and the common heritage of Africans during the fight against oppression.
-   **Yellow** represents the resource-rich regions, as well as peace and harmony between various ethnic and religious groups.
-   **Black** signifies the color of the people.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

## National colors

![[96f094b0f14f9c63b0cc7d712717ed6c_MD5.jpg]]

National colors are part of a country's set of national symbols, along with the flag, coat of arms, etc. Some of them are officially chosen; others tend to become well-known through popular use.

National colors often appear on countries' flags, athletes' uniforms, and local brands, among other things. Using national colors emphasizes the bond with the country. Businesses prefer using these colors on promotional campaigns related to national holidays.

## Red in Asia

![[51bd8ad5ef9ef632c45d28e66fb02986_MD5.jpg]]

Red is considered a positive color in many Asian cultures. It signifies long life, happiness, prosperity, and good luck.

In China, Vietnam, and some parts of India, it's customary for brides to wear red wedding dresses. During Lunar New Year, many Chinese people give others red envelopes with money. They also wear red during celebrations such as the Spring Festival.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup>

Interestingly, in East Asian stock markets, red signifies a rise in stock prices. That's the opposite of most other markets.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup>

## White in Asia

![[aa3d8b8350a5cb24e9e7e77e4e9ff437_MD5.jpg]]

In some Asian countries, the color white symbolizes bad luck, mourning, and death. This color is commonly worn at funerals in many Asian cultures.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[9]</a></sup>

However, not all meanings of white are negative, just like black in Western culture isn't exclusive to mourning. White also symbolizes brightness, purity, and fulfillment. It's widely used in consumer goods [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design), and it's a common color choice for cars.

## Muted colors in Nordic countries

![[f5c032f8fcc55804d738e8758f42f06d_MD5.jpg]]

Even if you aren't familiar with Scandinavian design, you've probably heard of Ikea. It's a popular Swedish company that sells affordable but good-quality furniture and home appliances.

Scandinavian design is characterized by subtle and muted colors and pastels. Think greys, white, and blues. Because winters are long and dark, it's important to make as much use of natural light as possible. But in the last few years, more color has started to appear in these countries.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[10]</a></sup>

Similar [color palettes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color-palette) are also used in [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) design. For example, McDonald's uses light color schemes with a lot of white for their websites in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-11" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[11]</a></sup>

## Vivid colors in India

![[7ab89f5f4653dd243cb04deda5a75272_MD5.jpg]]

India is a huge and diverse country, and it is reflected in its look. Everywhere — from the architecture to clothes to food — you'll notice bright, vivid colors. That's because color has been a large part of the Indian consciousness, and it stands out in every aspect of life.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[12]</a></sup>

Neutral colors aren't very common, black is usually associated with negativity and even bareness, and white is worn when mourning. Red is associated with prosperity and fertility. Primary and secondary colors like purple, yellow, orange, blue, and green have a positive meaning.

These color preferences are also reflected in UI design. Just check out the [Sephora India](https://sephora.nnnow.com/) website to see how its palette differs from its [global counterpart](https://www.sephora.com/).

## Yellow in Japan

![[347957749853fd9db90277a322e1387b_MD5.jpg]]

The traditional colors of Japan trace their historical origins to the dress code established in the 7th century. In this system, rank and social [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) were displayed and determined by specific colors.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-13" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[13]</a></sup>

Some colors, like purple and orange, were reserved for the robes of royalty and high-ranking officials, respectively. Blue was for everyone, from samurai to the common folk.

Nowadays, yellow in Japan is associated with light, youth, hope, and change. The golden [shade](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shades) of yellow symbolizes the sun and the power and mercy of the gods. As a result, gold is often used at temples and shrines.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-14" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[14]</a></sup>

## Green in the Southern Java

![[287bacf3cf28c48e7466f94fb05289d7_MD5.jpg]]

You might have read internet articles saying that wearing green is taboo in Indonesia. In reality, that's not true for most parts of Indonesia. However, it's a perfect example of how a color's meaning can be specific to a small region.

In the southern part of Java Island, wearing green is discouraged. There's no official law stating that you can't, but a local legend says that people who wear green are dragged to the sea by the Queen of the Sea.

A less mythical possible explanation is that the waters of the Indian Ocean that wash the southern shore of Java are green, and the waves are strong. If someone gets lost in the sea, green clothes will make it difficult to find the person.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-15" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[15]</a></sup>

When conducting market research about color, keep in mind that there might be regional variations in meaning.
