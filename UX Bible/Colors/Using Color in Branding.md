# Using Color in Branding
## Consumer perception

Color is one of the first things people notice about a [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) [composition](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition). It has a dramatic impact on their perception of the design they're looking at.

Want to build trust and loyalty? Blue is the way to go. Want consumers to think of your company as youthful and fun? Bright colors are your ticket. Want them to view your brand as solid and trustworthy? Try a dark green, navy blue, or burgundy palette.

The psychological impact of color has been widely studied, giving designers insights into the effects particular colors have depending on the situation. For example, if you want your football team to win more often, red uniforms may give them an edge — likely due to associations of red with aggression and passion.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup> But if you want students to perform better on tests, avoid exposing them to red beforehand, as their [test](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) scores are more likely to drop. The theory suggests that red can heighten anxiety, not to mention the association with red marks on a test indicating incorrect answers.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Brands and emotion

![[97533e4e487e1a57e856b3d1c01ce4d0_MD5.jpg]]

When choosing a color palette, brands should consider several factors. The emotional association with particular colors should be first and foremost. For example, if you're trying to create an association with tradition and formality, hot pink might not be the best color to base your palette around. For most people, it sparks feelings of joy, enthusiasm, and playfulness. 

Remember that color meanings in different cultures play an important [role](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/roles). For example, white is associated with minimalism, purity, and peace in much of the West. But in many Eastern countries, it's associated with death and mourning. Be sure to thoroughly [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) the cultural associations with any colors you're considering and your target audience. But beware; many references online discuss cultural meanings of various colors that simply aren't correct. When in doubt, ask locals if the meanings are accurate or not.

Finally, brands want to create a memorable color palette. McDonald's red and gold palette is memorable, and those colors immediately bring to mind the fast-food chain. But memorability isn't the only reason those colors were chosen; red can stimulate hunger, while yellow is associated with happiness. The memorability of a color palette is often based more on the emotions that the palette evokes in consumers than the colors themselves.

## Memorability

Choosing a color palette is just the first step in using color to establish a brand. Even the most strikingly original color palettes won't immediately have a brand association. That takes careful planning, implementation, and time. But by consistently using a color palette, it becomes part of a brand's identity.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

Use your chosen color palette throughout your brand and [marketing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/marketing) materials. It should be incorporated into your website designs, social media graphics, [logo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/logos), business [cards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards), ads, and any other materials associated with your brand. Through consistent use and repetition, consumers will come to recognize your color palette and the values and personality it represents for your brand.

## Color and brand personality

While neutrals serve a purpose in a brand's color palette, sticking to an entirely neutral palette is unlikely to leave a lasting impression on consumers. If you want to create a memorable color palette, pick colors that stand out and are unique.

Combining different tones, [tints](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/tints), and [shades](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shades) of primary colors (reds and yellows in this case) creates a memorable palette that customers are more likely to associate with a particular brand. Save the neutrals for the [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) or to unify other colors within the palette.

## Color and competition

When determining a brand's color palette, it's important to check out what the competition is doing. Certain colors and palettes have become synonymous with particular industries such as yellow and red for fast food. While that doesn't mean you have to stick to those colors in your own branding, it's a good idea to consider why those color palettes are so common.

You may decide that you want the brand you're designing for to stand out from its competitors. In that case, choosing an entirely unique color palette could be the way to go. But in some industries — banking and finance, for example — standing out as different and unique isn't always a smart decision. Using similar colors to the competition shows that your brand shares similar values and adheres to industry standards.

## Authenticity

Authenticity is one of those marketing buzzwords that can feel, well, inauthentic. But the underlying principle is essential. The brand's color palette should feel in line with the type of business or industry that the brand is in and meet that particular company's values.

If a consumer feels like the color palette is inappropriate for the type of business, it can subconsciously deter them from doing business with that company. For example, a bank that uses a bright blue and purple color palette (instead of more common industry colors like navy blue, burgundy, or green) may have to fight an uphill battle to gain brand recognition and build consumer trust.

## Personality

Every brand has a personality. When choosing colors for a brand, be sure to keep that personality in mind. Otherwise, it creates subconscious conflict in the minds of consumers, which can lead them to feel uneasy about the company as a whole.

For example, a brand with a fun, playful, and modern personality should stick to colors that evoke the same associations. A playful company wouldn't use a palette that's dark and traditional. Instead, they should choose bright, cheerful colors that reinforce their brand's personality.

**Tip!** When testing a color palette with users, ask them to describe the palette with a few adjectives to make sure it evokes the right associations for the brand.

## Appeal to your audience

Considering a brand's personality is vital to creating an effective color palette. But it's also critical to acknowledge the personalities of the audience. What types of brands do they want to associate themselves with?

For example, if the brand wants to target a youthful, trendsetting audience, its color palette needs to evoke those feelings. If it doesn't, then the palette won't resonate emotionally with its target audience.

## Differentiate your brand

Different industries have standard color palettes that a majority of companies use. For example, a lot of social media sites (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter included) use color palettes that rely heavily on blue. If someone wanted to create a competitor to these sites and use color to set themselves apart, then avoiding blue would be the first step.

That said, it's important to consider other factors when choosing a color palette, not just picking a color because it's different. In this example, green feels fresh and inviting, while dark gray gives the palette a grounded but modern appeal (especially when paired with white). Such a palette would stand out among the competition while also working with the brand's values.
