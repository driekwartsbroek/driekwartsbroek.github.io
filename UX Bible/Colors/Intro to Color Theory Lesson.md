# Intro to Color Theory Lesson
## Color wheel

![[c1eadddbacfff256ec6c192b3faee0ae_MD5.jpg]]

You might be familiar with the color wheel from art classes. It’s a circular representation of color hues, showing the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. The color wheel was originally presented by Sir Isaac Newton in his book Opticks in 1704.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

The color wheel is a valuable resource when creating color schemes and palettes. Traditionally, it contains 12 hues — 3 primary colors, 3 secondary colors, and 6 tertiary colors.

There are two types of color wheels. Artists typically use the subtractive color model, which is based on cyan, magenta, and yellow as primary colors. The model that is usually used online is the additive color wheel with red, green, and blue as primary colors.

## Warm colors

Warm colors are associated with love, fire, passion, and strong emotions. These are the colors you’d find in a beautiful sunset: an array of red, orange, yellow, and all of their variations. The concept of warm colors entered the artistic vocabulary during the 18th century by Irish poet Oliver Goldsmith.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Warm colors can be intense, especially when they’re used in their pure condition. Used as accent colors they can add life and excitement to a design. When used in large swaths, they can be overpowering if not tempered in other ways. In either case, they have a powerful impact on any design.

## Cool colors

![[7f7adad02b4e7dd303d17ce87cdf6281_MD5.jpg]]

Cool colors are popular choices for [branding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding). Blue is the most popular color worldwide. Other cool colors include green and purple, along with all of their variations. The concept of cool colors appeared even before warm by French art historian Roger de Piles in 1708.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

Cool colors are commonly seen in nature—in water, the sky, and plants. These colors evoke feelings of calmness and relaxation, as well as loyalty and trust (another reason they’re so popular in branding). Blue is also widely associated with text [links](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/links) in UX design.

## Neutral colors

It's tough to create an aesthetically pleasing design using only warm and cool colors. That's where neutral colors come in. Neutral colors are the most subtle of the bunch and include black, white, gray, and various [shades](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shades) of brown. Technically, brown is a muted [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) of orange and considered the warmest of the neutral hues.

Neutral colors are popularly used for [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography), [backgrounds](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background), and [wireframing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wireframing). They can be overpowered if not used properly, but can also be used to make accent colors stand out in your design.

**Tip!** Use neutral colors to make your product look more sophisticated.

## Color palette

![[c311397b7d6ef981a6214262f6d7bf30_MD5.jpg]]

Combining colors from one or more of these groups creates a color palette. In the digital world, a color palette is a combination of colors that pair well and create a desired mood or feeling. Warm colors create dynamic feelings; cool colors create calming feelings; neutrals can be used to enhance or soften either of those or to create sophisticated feelings. 

Using a consistent color palette gives your users a feel for your product or brand’s personality. It can help unify different products or offerings across a brand by giving users a familiar touchpoint. Consistent color palettes are the visual building blocks for your product.

[Designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) do not always have to create a color palette from scratch. If a product or service has existed for a while, there is a chance a brand book/brand guidelines are already in place.

## Primary colors

![[5cec0dcaacb0c283900513f9c8562478_MD5.jpg]]

Primary colors are the root of every other color, impossible to form by blending other hues. In the subtractive color model (used in printing, silk-screening, and painting), primary colors include cyan, magenta, and yellow. In the additive color model (used by digital displays), they are red, green, and blue.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

In design, primary colors have a powerful visual and psychological impact. They're often used as accent colors in their pure forms, so as not to be overpowering. When you want to make an impact, though, leaning on primary colors can do exactly that.

## Secondary colors

![[87f536fecab9c8958cac833d90bd9d2d_MD5.jpg]]

Secondary colors are created when combining two primary hues. In the subtractive color model, secondary colors include red, blue, and green, while in the additive model, they are cyan, magenta, and yellow.

Notice that the subtractive primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) become secondary colors in the additive model. Likewise, red, blue, and green are primary colors in the additive model and secondary colors in the subtractive model. Even though these color models work in opposite ways, they're intricately related to one another.

## Tertiary colors

![[b6bd625ad968351375ead7b98c9fdb68_MD5.jpg]]

Tertiary colors are created when combining a primary and secondary hue in equal measure. In both additive and subtractive color models, they include hues such as azure, orange, and violet. It happens because the primary and secondary hues in the two models are inverted, but include the same six hues.

Combining tertiary colors with primary or secondary colors creates yet another level: quaternary colors.

## HEX triplet

![[6d0cb25491466a3ae1d2e7849dc215bf_MD5.jpg]]

Hex triplets are one way to represent RGB colors and are commonly used to specify colors in [CSS](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/css). Hex colors are prefixed with a “#” and typically include six hexadecimal digits (numbers 0–9 and letters A–F).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

The first two digits are for the red value, the second two are for green, and the last two are for blue. In some cases, they may include a fourth pair of digits, which represent the color’s opacity or _alpha_. Rarely, you may see 3-digit hex colors, with only one digit representing each RGB value.

## RGB color model

![[6bd59d78c1dbc9d4a75157222aee7ce1_MD5.jpg]]

The RGB color model (which stands for Red, Green, Blue) is what [UX](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) designers most commonly work with since it's used by electronic displays. It combines red, green, and blue lights to create more than 16 million colors (16,777,216 to be exact). Note that RGB is a device-dependent color model, meaning different [devices](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device) will display RGB values differently.

The RGB color model is based on human perception of color and how our eyes perceive colors in the light spectrum. According to the trichromatic theory, humans see color as combinations of red, green, and blue using three types of cones in their eyes.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

## Additive color model

![[f4b47fef31d7fec839b9e37d597b218e_MD5.jpg]]

In the design world, the additive color model is the most commonly used since it's what digital displays use. The primary colors in an additive color model are red, green, and blue (RGB).

The term "additive" refers to the fact that as you add colors to the mix, the result gets progressively lighter, all the way to white when all colors are combined. James Clerk Maxwell is largely credited as the father of additive color for his experimental work regarding light and the color spectrum. In 1861, he presented the very first color [photography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos) at the Royal Institution.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup>

## Subtractive color model

![[09937790cff5736e251a8975aa53ba32_MD5.jpg]]

The subtractive color model is a blend of pigments, inks, paints, or dyes. It's called subtractive because every time a new color is added, the mix reflects less light and gets darker, tending toward black.

In art, the subtractive color model is based on the primary colors most of us learned as children: red, yellow, and blue. In printing and design, though, the subtractive color model is based on cyan, magenta, and yellow. More colors can be accurately reproduced by combining those three hues along with a key color, generally black.
