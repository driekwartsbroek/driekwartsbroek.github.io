![Red](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/red-1632309992906/a-1632309992906.jpg)

Red is the most powerful and also contradictory of the colors. On the one hand, color context stands for love, passion, desire, and health. On the other hand, it conveys danger, anger, violence, and fear.

Above all, red is hard to ignore, and that's why red traffic lights and stop signs utilize red for [warning](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/warning) and getting people's attention fast. For similar reasons, people who wear red tend to stand out from the crowd. Roughly 64% of the cones in the human eye are sensitive to red light wavelengths, which is why the color is so noticeable.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

In many cultures, red symbolizes vital energy, fertility, and good health. For example, Chinese brides wear red gowns and walk on red carpets. In Greece, Albania, and Armenia, too, brides still wear red veils.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>
