![[aad8a577cab6e7512e142b59134ec773_MD5.jpg]]

Let's play a small game. We tell you a chain of words, and you think of colors associated with these concepts. Ready? Let's go!

-   Airplanes, flights, and airports
-   Tasty food, hunger, calories
-   Communications, technology, [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) devices

For the first set of words, you're likely to imagine the color blue or red; for the second — red, orange, or green; for the third — gray, blue, or black.

According to a study conducted by a UK insurance intermediary, many industries are prone to using particular colors in their [branding](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/branding). They select colors that have the intended psychological influence on consumers and also create the right [image](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) of the industry. In turn, people start subconsciously associating those colors with particular industry sectors.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

For example, many airline companies pick blue to represent trust and security (e.g., United Airlines or All Nippon Airways) and red to ensure a caring attitude (e.g., American Airlines, British Airways, or Austrian Airlines).

Black represents strength and security, so you can see it in the logos of Queclink and Laird PLC.

Red, yellow, and green are the most common colors for restaurants and food companies (KFC, Subway, or Starbucks) as they're usually associated with appetite, energy, and health.

## Color palettes of famous brands

Reds and yellows are astonishingly stimulating, active, and outspoken colors. It's a pretty well-known fact that you shouldn't eat from red, yellow, or orange plates if you want to lose weight. These colors increase your metabolism and appetite — that's why they are the most popular colors in fast-food chains, like McDonald's, KFC, Wendy's, and Pizza Hut.

Although those colors can make your customers feel hungry and crave your food, it's a challenge for your brand to stand out. What you can do is incorporate other accent colors (look at the Wendy's [logo](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/logos) that where even unappetizing blue looks on-point) and put a lot of thought into the brand name and logomark.

## Color palettes associated with holidays

![[da1e3c406e1490ee2a237e59e7ecc291_MD5.jpg]]

Although there are cultural differences in holiday associations, it's also important to remember how do colors affect moods or evoke particular memories or feelings among many users.

Specific [shades](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shades) of red and green may be associated with Christmas time and its attributes like magnificent Christmas trees, red stockings hanging over the fireplace, beautiful evergreen wreaths, candy canes, and mistletoe. In turn, a blend of orange and black immediately brings to mind Halloween, carved pumpkins, candles, black cats, candy corn, and vampires.

When selecting a [color palette](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color-palette), keep these associations in mind and make sure to pick hues that promote the feelings you would like users to have when they see your product.

## Color palettes in film & TV

![[428cbc5c7244f9484400b673b68c95bc_MD5.jpg]]

In filmmaking, color is one of the most powerful [tools](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) used to express mood, evoke certain emotions, or convey a spirit of specific eras. Moreover, the best film directors have a recognizable [style](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/style) and color palettes that people associate with their movies.

Wes Anderson's pastel color palettes used in his works always feel dream-like and a bit nostalgic. The muted pink in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ or hazy oranges and greens in _Moonrise Kingdom_ help the cinematographer create a unique atmosphere for his characters to live in and creates a particular mood for viewers.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

People tend to associate romantic movies with consistently bright and more saturated colors. They feel more relaxed, safe, and eager to laugh seeing characters highlighted with cheerful light. Conversely, dramatic scenes are linked to melancholic dark or muted blue, green, black, or gray. Not to mention that heroes and villains can also be easily revealed by color.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>

## Color palettes in nature

![[eca1c679f1f96e8f05d01339d38642c8_MD5.jpg]]

Nature is probably the most talented artist in the world and uses a variety of colors to paint every blade of grass and every bird's feather.

Just the thought of natural landscapes like seashores, mountains, meadows, or forests calls to mind images of crystal blues and lush greens. Yellow, brown, and red hues can also be found in nature, but they're rarer and don't evoke such strong feelings of tranquillity and refreshment.

Scientists suggest that our positive associations with green and blue have been rooted in our brains through evolution.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[5]</a></sup>

## Color palettes in pop culture

![[e664b89c10501240890d0a4dd61ee877_MD5.jpg]]

Remember [Apple's early iPod commercials](https://youtu.be/IjxSNwenylk), with dark silhouettes dancing to a tune against colorful [backgrounds](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background)? Well, that's an excellent example of how a company sold more than just a product, but a feeling or lifestyle.

People got attached to the iPod on an emotional level, and colors from these commercials became a trend. Lime green, Barbie doll pink, cyan blue, and bright yellow crawled into many iconic movies and TV shows, like _Mean Girls, Skins,_ or _Family Guy_. Not to mention the rise in popularity of colored skinny jeans and Crocs observed at that time. Nowadays, flashy colors of the early 2000s look outdated and create a somewhat retro feeling instead of being trendy and refreshing.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[6]</a></sup>

While selecting the color palette for your website or app, don't focus on trendy colors only. What may seem absolutely up-to-date today will feel like a passing fad in a few years.

## Color palettes for specific eras

![[ff65ce7e545df4417f147ee74406e6d8_MD5.jpg]]

If you enjoy watching movies from different decades, you're likely to notice that some colors dominate particular eras, creating specific moods and feelings. The popularity of different colors across the decades isn't accidental. Events in society, fashion, music, and art shaped the [role](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/roles) of color.

For example, in the 1950s, America was swept by consumerism, glamor, and prosperity. Delicate and powdery pastels, such as pinks, blues, and greens, conveyed feelings of youth, warmth, and joy. Nowadays, these colors are used to create a vintage atmosphere associated with this era.

The 1970s were signified by a tremendous revolution in television when most stations worldwide upgraded from black-and-white to color transmission.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[7]</a></sup> Furthermore, on the 22nd of April in 1970, Earth Day was celebrated for the first time in the US and aimed at increasing public awareness of the world's environmental problems. Earth tones took the scene in this era, and the palette became decidedly more nature-inspired in general: harvest gold, rusty oranges, chocolate browns, overripe avocado green, etc.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[8]</a></sup>
