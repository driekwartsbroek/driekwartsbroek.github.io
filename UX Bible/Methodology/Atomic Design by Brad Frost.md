## Atoms

Atoms are the basic [HTML](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/html) elements like [form](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/forms) [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), [inputs](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/inputs), [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), and other basic [properties](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/property) like [colors](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color), [fonts](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/fonts), and border-radii that can't be broken any further. At an individual level, atoms are abstract concepts with no real meaning. But when combined, they start to create more meaningful elements called molecules.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Modifying a single atom has a ripple effect on the entire design. Change a font, for example, and the entire look of the site’s [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography) is changed. Atoms are likely to show up on a mood board that might be presented to stakeholders on a design project but aren’t really deliverables on their own.

## Molecules

**Molecules are made up of atoms bonded together.** They are simple [UI components](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-components) like buttons, [checkboxes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkboxes), inputs, and similar elements functioning together as a unit. For example, if you combine a [placeholder](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/placeholder), label, input, button, and magnifying glass [icon](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) you can create a [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search) bar. Molecules are the most basic elements that start to resemble an actual design system.

## Organisms

**Organisms are made up of molecules. These are complete UI components and start to really form the backbone of the overall product design**. Organisms include things like forms, [cards](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards), or [modals](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/modals). To create a form organism, for example, you’d combine things like labels, inputs, and button molecules. 

You can see that on an individual level, organisms don’t provide a whole lot of user value, but they’re key elements to an overall design. Without organisms, the final product would lack a lot of functionality.

## Templates

**When you start to combine organisms, you end up with templates, where a design really starts to take [shape](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/shapes).** Templates in atomic design are the equivalent of [wireframes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wireframe) containing grayscale placeholders before real [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) is available. They create a tangible product that can be shared with stakeholders and users for feedback. 

Templates spell out how the design will come together but don’t include actual content from the product. They’re just a skeleton, but also a key step in the [design process](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-process). They start to show how the final product will actually look and work. 

At the template stage, you should consider getting developer feedback to make sure that the design is workable. They can also be shown to clients as a way to support the ideas and concepts you’ve already talked to them about.

## Pages

The final results of the atomic design process are pages. Pages are built on top of templates, with real content filled in. They’re not yet functional products, but they show the finished look, feel, and content of the design.

Pages can be used for real-world [user testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-testing). They should be used to get final stakeholder feedback before the designs are handed off to developers to become functional products.
