When you take on a new UX design project, you don’t just dive into creating the actual [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design). There are steps you need to take before you start designing the actual product.

One of the best places to start the creative process after the discovery phase is mind maps. Mind maps are visual representations of ideas around a central topic or concept. They can be created alone or during [brainstorming](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/brainstorming) sessions with your team.

Mind maps offer an effective way to explore all possible ideas to create solutions for various design problems.

## User persona

![[Attachments/c9d442dfee7984495ad6c8f5e9145a7a_MD5.jpg]]

Since UX design centers on the user, creating user [personas](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/personas) early on in the process is an important part of designing products. User personas are semi-fictional characters that represent your target audience. They usually include demographic details and information about users' education, skills, goals, and obstacles in the way of these goals. User personas help the design team [empathize](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/empathy) with users.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

Good personas should rely on data. Conduct user [interviews](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview), evaluate [analytics](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-analytics), and make use of other [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) tools within your budget and time limits.

Sometimes, [UX](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) practitioners create proto personas based on assumptions, but they could only be used for [testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/testing) ideas and should never become a reference point for developing final design solutions.

**Tip!** Learn how to create personas and explore the use of this tool in UX research in the [Personas in UX Research](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ux-research/personas-205) lesson.

## User flow diagram

The goal of every product is to guide users toward a certain goal or destination. To guide users, you’ll need to know what that destination is. [User flow](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow) diagrams help you visualize all the paths your users might take. In order to create an effective diagram, study the data of user behavior on your product. This will help determine all the possible [interactions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) they take.

## Storyboard

![[Attachments/f32ad10aa3029f0eefa50f44272808e1_MD5.jpg]]

Storyboards are comic book-style visualizations of a story that gives the whole picture of the environment in which users interact with a product.

Storyboards consist of 3 main components:

-   Scenarios: Scenarios informally describe a specific fragment of a user journey taken by a persona.
-   Visuals: visuals (sketches, [photos](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/photos), or [illustrations](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/illustration)) represent each step of a journey.
-   Captions: captions are text comments that accompany each visual and describe users' [actions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions), environment, emotional [state](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/states), [device](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/device), and other important details. 

Storyboards provide additional context and put teams in users' shoes, giving them additional insight into what they can do to improve the user’s journey. Involving your entire team in the generation process can create a more accurate and realistic [storyboard](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/storyboard).<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## Customer journey map

![[Attachments/34c67b62fad28e46f5a2160f91c209c8_MD5.jpg]]

[Customer journey maps](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/journey-mapping) are diagrams of customers’ digital and non-digital touchpoints with a product, usually including all of the touchpoints they have.[<sup>[1]&nbsp;</sup>](https://hbr.org/2010/11/using-customer-journey-maps-to) 

Pleasant and unpleasant moments in a user’s journey are also included in these maps. Unlike user flow diagrams, they’re more focused on the emotional experience and behavior of users. User interviews are the best way to gain insights for creating customer journey maps.

You may choose to share these customer journey maps with other stakeholders and that can dictate the format they take. In general, you can use tools like sticky notes, spreadsheets, diagramming apps, or whiteboards, to create them.

## Experience map

![[Attachments/262f82351d9ed36db4358f88ad0e1bec_MD5.jpg]]

When you want to define a more general idea of how users reach a goal, [experience maps](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/experience-mapping) are the way to go. Unlike customer journey maps that focus on specific customer interaction, experience maps describe general user behavior.

They illustrate a generic end-to-end experience of users on their way to a goal, such as how customers feel while ordering takeout food without the reference to a specific product or service like Mcdonald's or UberEats.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## Empathy map

![[Attachments/fe5c65d311f66467392b57748c1a881a_MD5.jpg]]

[Empathy maps](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/empathy-maps) help your design team understand and prioritize user needs.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup> Traditionally, they contain four sections — Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels. Fill each section from the user’s perspective. Ideally, they should contain data gathered from real user research rather than speculation.

**Tip!** Explore the [Empathy Maps](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/ux-research/empathy-maps-625?utm_source=share-lesson) lesson to learn how to create empathy maps and develop a better understanding of users' needs and make better design decisions.

## Service blueprint

![[Attachments/1cd513fbe1ca5e1acb307fc6e432da32_MD5.jpg]]

Service blueprints are diagrams that visualize the entire process of service delivery. They include all of the parties involved in the delivery of a service, including digital artifacts and the people who work behind the scenes. They give a bird’s eye view of the whole process and can point out gaps and weaknesses in both the user experience and back-end mechanisms.

## Site Map

![[Attachments/cf231b9adb91f66a71b30f08614c5cad_MD5.jpg]]

Site maps are hierarchical diagrams that show the relationships between the components of a product. They give a high-level overview of the [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation) structure and groups of content. Your [site map](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/site-map) should be based on the user journeys and personas you’ve created to best meet your users’ needs.

## Wireframe

![[Attachments/9cabfd40b58b93fae0c121a59f59158a_MD5.jpg]]

Once you know the types of [pages](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/pages) your product will include, you can start creating wireframes for those pages. Wireframes are static, low-fidelity models of your product.

Don’t worry about details like [color palettes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color-palette) or [typography](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/typography) at this stage. Focus instead on arranging the elements of the design and planning out the structure and navigation.

Wireframes are usually made up of grayscale lines and boxes, showing positions and visual [hierarchy](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/hierarchy) rather than full functionality. They’re an easy and cheap way to evaluate ideas and get user feedback.

**Tip!** Explore the [Wireframing](https://app.uxcel.com/courses/designing-wireframes) course to find out how to incorporate wireframes into your design process.

## Prototype

![Prototype](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/prototype-1599139051878/a-1658230196663.jpg)

Prototypes are interactive models that show what the final product will look like. Their main goal is to simulate interactions and test functionality. They’re built on wireframe skeletons but add some meat to the structure in the form of basic content and visuals. A high-fidelity, realistic prototype will attract high-quality feedback from users and stakeholders. So feel free to use [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images), videos, [animations](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/animation), [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) [gestures](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/gestures), and other interactions to give users an accurate picture of the final product.

However, a prototype can also be low-fidelity and use digital or paper grayscale wireframes or hand-drawn sketches to simulate basic user flows.

## Usability report

![[Attachments/b767e6d10f3e43ef9cd6a8aac3ad93e5_MD5.jpg]]

It’s important to evaluate [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) before finalizing your product’s design and functionality. Usability reports are documents that include all findings from usability evaluations. They cover information about participants, tasks, tools, insights, and any final recommendations for changes. 

Be clear and concise in your usability reports. Don’t use jargon that non-designers won’t understand since people with all different roles and [backgrounds](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) will read your report.
