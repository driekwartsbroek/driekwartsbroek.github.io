# Design Processes & Research Methods
## Design sprint

![[4fac4a4cab7d40bc30353104ddd7b330_MD5.webp]]

Design sprints were originally developed by Jake Knapp.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup> They can help [designers](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/designer) quickly come up with ideas and solve problems.

Usually, a [design sprint](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-sprint) includes five stages, with each one lasting a single day. Those stages include mapping, sketching, deciding, [prototyping](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/prototyping), and testing.

The idea is that when you work this fast, you fail faster and learn more quickly. Ideas are tested quickly so that a perfecmagnoliamagnolnmmt solution is found faster.

## Design thinking

![[3d8f126f4543089894725fdfcef5aa0b_MD5.webp]]

[Design thinking](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-thinking) is the way to solve design problems in 5 stages: [empathize](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/empathy), define, ideate, [prototype](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/prototype), and test.

-   Designers [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) users' needs
-   Define their problems
-   Generate ideas to solve these problems
-   Visualize the most solid ideas
-   Test those ideas using either low- or high-fidelity prototypes 

Design thinking isn’t necessarily a linear process. One of the most important characteristics of this approach is its iterative nature. Designers often go back to previous stages to revise the solution until the best possible design is created. 

Ideally, you should use design thinking from the moment you embark on a project.

**Tip!** Introduce design thinking at the early design stages. Otherwise, you risk creating products that don't solve users' problems and meet no one's needs.

## Double Diamond

The Double Diamond technique divides the design process into four D’s: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. The first two stages are about the problem [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing), exploring users and their needs. The latter two are about the solution space and focus on testing the insights gained during the first phase. 

Designers can return ideas to previous stages to explore them further until they find the perfect solution.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

## User research

![[f93995d17314b2ebc6c377d82bb04030_MD5.webp]]

User research is a crucial part of the design process. Designers and researchers use user research to study the product's target audience to understand user behavior, needs, and motivation. The goal is to expose problems and design opportunities to allow creators to make the best designs. 

UX [research methods](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-methods) are based on [psychology](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/psychology), [marketing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/marketing), ethnography, and other related disciplines. When conducting user research, always consider the high-level product goal and the resources you have at your disposal.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[3]</a></sup>

## User interview

![[1f4139c46ea6388f02c839061c18ea24_MD5.webp]]

User interviews are one-on-one conversations between a user and interviewer. It’s a useful method for gaining insights into users' attitudes, needs, and [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background).

User interviews can be combined with [usability testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability-testing), during which you can see how users interact with a product. During the [interview](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview), you can ask questions to get a better understanding of users’ behavior. 

When UX researchers explore the problem space, user interviews usually are not paired with usability tests.

**Tip!** Consider doing contextual interviews, where you can observe users in their usual workspaces. This gives even more insight into how users interact with your product.

## User testing

![[55f6e7def9e94b2040a75320c1115ea4_MD5.jpg]]

[User testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-testing) is an integral part of the user research process. There are various tests you can run on users, depending on the stage of the design process you’re in. 

Some tests are cheaper and can be done early on, such as guerilla testing using paper mockups. Others, like [eye tracking](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/eye-tracking) testing, require equipment, high-fidelity prototypes, arranged focus groups, or even user research laboratories.

All kinds of user testing pursue the same goal — to gather feedback. This allows discovering any potential problems as early in the design process as possible.

## A/B testing

![[0635ee4a87782d947f336431dc2dbc02_MD5.jpg]]

One of the most common types of user testing is [A/B testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ab-testing). It allows you to compare the effectiveness and [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability) of two product versions and understand which is better. 

A/B testing is generally done by randomly showing one of the two versions of the product to users without showing them the other version. It's essential to test only one design element at a time for the most accurate and usable results. 

A/B testing provides objective and statistical — quantitative — data, but it doesn't explain users' behavior. That's why it's best suited for later stages of the design process or at the start of a redesign process. Typical [use cases](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/use-case) include refining [color palettes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/color-palette) or comparing how two [images](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/images) impact user behavior.

## UX audit

![[c155231f4e9b0c1a960a8b6f8d599d46_MD5.jpg]]

A UX audit is a product's [user interface](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) evaluation. It involves creating a document that contains user research, user testing data, and other elements that impact user experience. The audit is a detailed report that can contain various components such as:

-   Business analysis
-   [Personas](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/personas) description
-   Technical audit
-   A/B testing results
-   Surveys
-   Interviews
-   [Wireframes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/wireframe)
-   Prototypes

The primary goal of a [UX audit](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-audit) is to identify any problems and provide recommended solutions for eliminating UX gaps. Hiring an outside UX professional to offer an objective, critical opinion about the product can be a good idea.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[4]</a></sup>
