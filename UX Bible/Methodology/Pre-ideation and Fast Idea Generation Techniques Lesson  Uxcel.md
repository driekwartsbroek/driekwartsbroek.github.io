Ideation is an important part of the [service design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/service-design) process because it helps generate a large number of ideas for potential solutions for a particular problem. It is necessary to plan in advance to ensure that the ideation process is structured and effective in generating useful ideas. This can involve:

-   **Defining a starting point/scope.** Examine your previous work, [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge), or [prototyping](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/prototyping) results, and decide on your ideation's starting point and scope. For instance, if the challenge is to [design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design) a new online shopping experience, the starting point could be the current shopping experience, and the scope could be the design of a new interface.
-   **Gathering [background](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/background) information.** Gather insights and inspiration from previous research, [prototypes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/prototype), and artifacts. For example, the project team could review customer feedback and insights from [user testing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-testing) and look at successful e-commerce sites for inspiration.
-   **Splitting the challenge.** Break down the challenge into manageable parts. For instance, the ideation challenge for a new shopping interface could be divided into tasks such as browsing [products](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/product), the [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout) process, and customer service.
-   **Selecting contributors.** Identify who could contribute meaningfully to each opportunity area. This could include end-users, experts, and stakeholders from the organization. For example, the team could include a mix of designers, developers, and customer service representatives.
-   **Choosing ideation methods.** Line up a sequence of ideation methods, such as mind mapping, brainwriting, or SCAMPER, to fill your idea portfolio and select the best suitable ones for your challenge.
-   **Planning ideation loops.** Plan a series of ideation and decision-making sessions that build on each other. For example, the team could start with a [brainstorming](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/brainstorming) session, followed by a prototyping session, and end with a decision-making session to select the best ideas.
-   **[Setting](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/settings) stopping criteria.** Define criteria for when to stop ideating, such as setting the number of ideas you want to generate.
-   **Determining outputs.** Decide on the number of selected ideas and the format they should take. This could include creating prototypes or developing a roadmap for implementation.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[1]</a></sup>

## Slicing the elephant

![[c0738bd02b554f33a64131bc2e96f1cc_MD5.jpg]]

Slicing the elephant is a pre-ideation technique used to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. It involves taking a large problem and breaking it down into more specific components that can be more easily addressed.

The first step is visualizing the problem as an elephant and then slicing it into smaller pieces. Each slice represents a specific aspect or component of the problem. The team then focuses on one slice at a time, generating ideas and solutions for that particular component. For example, consider that the goal is improving customer satisfaction with a particular product.

The team might break this down into smaller components: product [features](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/feature), [user experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience), customer service, and [pricing](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/price). They would then focus on each component separately, generating ideas and solutions for enhancing each one.

## Mind mapping

Mind mapping is a visual [tool](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-tools) for organizing information and ideas and generating new insights and connections that may not have been apparent before.

**Here are some steps to follow when using mind mapping for ideation:**

-   Start with a central idea or concept related to the challenge you are working on. Write it down in the center of a piece of paper or whiteboard, and draw a circle around it.
-   Brainstorm related ideas, concepts, and themes that come to mind, writing each one down in a new bubble and connecting it to the central idea with a line. Try to generate as many ideas as possible without judging or evaluating them.
-   Look for connections and patterns between the different ideas and themes. This can help identify underlying issues or opportunities that may not have been immediately obvious.
-   Refine and categorize the ideas into groups or clusters based on their similarity or relevance to the challenge.
-   Use the mind map to generate further ideas and insights as a visual reference point to spark new connections and possibilities.
-   Select the most promising ideas from the mind map to develop further, using other ideation techniques to refine and expand upon them.

A service design team working on improving the [customer experience](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/customer-experience) for a retail store might use mind mapping to generate ideas for enhancing the in-store experience. The central idea might be "customer experience," with related ideas including "store [layout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/layout-composition)," "staff training," "product selection," and "customer feedback."

By exploring these ideas further, the team might identify opportunities for redesigning the store layout, improving staff training, or implementing a new feedback system to gather customer insights.

## Empathy mapping

Empathy mapping is a technique used in service design to gain a deeper understanding of target users’ needs, behaviors, and motivations. It involves creating a visual representation of the user experience and the factors that influence their decision-making.

Here are the steps to follow for empathy mapping in service design:

-   **Identify target users.** This could be existing users, potential customers, or a user group that you want to design for.
-   **Collect user data.** Gather data about users through [interviews](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interview), observations, surveys, and other [research methods](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-methods). This information could include their demographic information, their pain points, their behaviors, their motivations, and their goals.
-   **Create an [empathy map](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/empathy-maps) template.** Draw a template with four quadrants representing what users think, feel, say, and do.
-   **Fill in the empathy map.** Use the data you collected to fill in each quadrant of the empathy map. For example, in the "thinks" quadrant, you could write down what users’ thoughts are about the service. In the "feels" quadrant, you could write down what emotions they experience while using the service.
-   **Analyze the empathy map.** Look for patterns and insights that emerge from the empathy map. This will help you understand users’ needs and motivations and identify opportunities for improving the service.
-   **Use the empathy map to inform design decisions.** Use the insights from the empathy map to inform the design decisions you make. For example, if you notice that users are frustrated with a certain aspect of the service, you could redesign that aspect to make it more user-friendly.

## Brainwriting

Brainwriting is an ideation technique that involves generating and sharing ideas within a group without verbal [communication](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/communication). It allows participants to share their thoughts without fearing being judged or interrupted, which can help generate a wider range of ideas. In a brainwriting session, participants write down their ideas on a sheet of paper, then pass it to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas to the same sheet, and so on, until all participants have contributed their ideas.<sup><a href="moz-extension://1fff0f8b-616f-485f-8cf3-32584a1a9298/#anchor-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" applinkanchor="">[2]</a></sup>

Brainwriting sessions are beneficial when working with individuals who may feel more comfortable expressing their ideas in a written format rather than verbally. Brainwriting can foster a greater diversity of thought compared to traditional brainstorming sessions. Giving participants time to reflect and write individually allows them to draw from their unique perspectives and experiences, leading to a broader range of ideas. To run a brainwriting session:

-   **Define the problem.** Begin by defining the problem or challenge that you want to address. For example, your challenge might be to design a more efficient and enjoyable in-store shopping experience for a retail store.
-   **Set up the brainwriting session.** Provide each participant with a sheet of paper and pens or pencils. Explain the rules and process for the brainwriting session. For instance, participants will have 5 minutes to write down as many ideas as possible without speaking with others.
-   **Start generating ideas.** Once the problem has been introduced, give participants time to write down as many ideas as possible.
-   **Pass the papers.** After the time is up, have the participants pass their papers to the person on their left or right. Participants will then add their own ideas to the sheet of paper they have received, building on the ideas of the previous person or adding new ones. Repeat this process for several rounds until everyone has had the opportunity to contribute to every sheet of paper.
-   **Review and discuss the ideas.** Discuss and refine the ideas generated, and prioritize the ones with the most potential. For example, you could review the ideas for improving the in-store shopping experience, such as redesigning the store layout, adding interactive displays, or providing personalized recommendations.

**Tip!** Allowing everyone to write down their thoughts simultaneously during the brainwriting session reduces the influence of more assertive or dominant participants.

## 10 plus 10

![[5d6bbf1a9583eba7de2835d9bce97a34_MD5.jpg]]

The 10 plus 10 ideation technique can be used to generate a large number of ideas in a short amount of time. It involves splitting participants into smaller groups and asking them to generate 10 ideas each within a set time limit. After the first round, the groups swap their ideas with another group and then build on each other's ideas to generate another 10 ideas.

Here's how to run a 10 plus 10 ideation session:

-   **Define the challenge.** Begin by defining the challenge or problem you want to address through service design ideation. For instance, you might want to improve the user experience of a [mobile](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/mobile) banking app.
-   **Divide participants into smaller groups.** Divide participants into smaller groups of around 3-5 people. Make sure each group has a mix of skills and perspectives to encourage diverse ideas.
-   **Set a time limit.** Set a time limit of 5-10 minutes and ask each group to come up with 10 ideas relevant to your challenge.
-   **Swap ideas with another group.** Once the time is up, ask each group to swap their ideas with another group. Each group should read and analyze the ideas they received and then build on them to come up with another 10 ideas.
-   **Collect and share ideas.** Use a whiteboard or other visual aid to organize and categorize the ideas.
-   **Discuss and prioritize ideas.** Have a group discussion about the ideas generated, and identify the ones that have the most potential or are the most feasible to implement. Prioritize the ideas and create an [action](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/actions) plan for further development and implementation.

## SCAMPER

![[96486265455aea0de4fe8efb2f1539ee_MD5.jpg]]

![[74a890808de0ca1b9e6af0f859b8cd73_MD5.jpg]]

SCAMPER is a technique used to generate new ideas by exploring different ways to modify an existing product, service, or process. To run a SCAMPER ideation session, define the challenge or problem you want to address. For example, you might want to improve the customer experience for a hotel check-in process. Next, use the SCAMPER technique to explore different ways to modify the existing service.

Here are some examples of how to apply each SCAMPER technique:

-   **Substitute:** What could you substitute in the check-in process to make it faster or more convenient? Could you replace the front desk with self-check-in kiosks?
-   **Combine:** What other services or features could you combine with the check-in process to make it more attractive to customers? Could you offer free breakfast or a welcome drink for guests who check in early?
-   **Adapt:** How could you adapt the check-in process to better meet the needs of different types of customers? Could you offer a separate check-in process for families with young children or for business travelers who need a quiet [space](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/spacing) to work?
-   **Modify:** How could you modify the check-in process to make it more efficient or personalized? Could you use mobile technology to send personalized messages to guests before they arrive or to notify them when their room is ready?
-   **Put to another use:** How could you repurpose elements of the check-in process to serve a different purpose? Could you use the check-in kiosks as information hubs to offer local recommendations or services?
-   **Eliminate:** What elements of the check-in process could you eliminate to make it more streamlined? Could you remove the requirement for a credit [card](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/cards) on file if guests pay in advance?
-   **Reverse/Rearrange:** What would happen if you reversed or rearranged the check-in process? Could you offer guests the option to check in through a mobile app before they arrive?

After applying the SCAMPER technique, collect and share the ideas generated by the group. Use a whiteboard or other visual aid to organize and categorize the ideas. Have a group discussion about the ideas generated, and identify the ones that have the most potential or are the most feasible to implement. Prioritize the ideas and create an action plan for further development and implementation.
